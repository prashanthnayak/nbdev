    "\r\n",
    "## Core Philosophy\r\n",
    "- **Without spiritual discipline, learning Jyotish is difficult** - understanding all charts (past, present, future) requires spiritual support\r\n",
    "- Parashara Jyotish is deeply connected to spirituality (Vishnu Purana, Rigveda)\r\n",
    "- **Appreciation of Guru** is the first and most important step\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Key Practices Introduced\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 1. **Guru Vandana**\r\n",
    "- Prayer/worship of the Guru (13 stanzas)\r\n",
    "- Done first thing after morning bath\r\n",
    "- Can be recited in one sitting as daily Guru prayer\r\n",
    "- Traditionally sung at initiations in the parampara\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 2. **Pancha Devatas (Five Deities)**\r\n",
    "These represent the five tattvas and are worshipped in order:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. **Ganesha** (Prithvi/Earth) - Must be worshipped first; sits in Muladhara chakra\r\n",
    "2. **Surya** (Agni/Fire) - Establishes energy levels\r\n",
    "3. **Vishnu** (Akasha/Space) - Grants purity and connection\r\n",
    "4. **Devi** (Jala/Water) - Brings sustenance and empathy\r\n",
    "5. **Shiva** (Vayu/Air) - Stops storms in life\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Important**: Any one of these five can lead to moksha if worshipped properly.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
