    "are going to be very thorough and we are starting from the very beginning so you\n",
    "know with that you know it requires a bit of patience because we are just going to learn the building blocks for\n",

    "note the whole of the uh Shara you know these pre- lessons that we want you to\n",
    "kind of Focus right now it's those are Preparatory lessons you know they they are meant to give you kind of The Wider\n",
    "understanding of what is that you know we are studying here because um normally\n",
    "or usually when we open the book we usually open parashar hastra book you\n",
    "know we start with the third chapter where we go straight to the graa and\n",
    "Rashia and all the all the juicy stuff but uh what what would that mean without\n",
    "giving you kind of the you know the base the philosophy of everything is kind of going straight to operate on the heart\n",
    "Without Really knowing everything that is there the whole body and how everything works so these Preparatory\n",
    "lessons are really good for you and you know don't don't feel intimidated because there's so much there and\n",
    "there's so much Phil deep philosophical knowledge you know deep spiritual knowledge we do not expect of you to\n",
    "know these things this is something that we all come back to so even though I've\n",
    "been i' uh I've started you know uh pjc course when Guru originally taught it in\n",
    "2011 I still go to those lessons because now they have a very different meaning\n",
    "you know you keep on you know learning new things but then when you go back\n",
    "when you dial down back to the basics and those Bas Basics suddenly have a completely different meaning and that is\n",
    "what we are dealing with you know we're dealing with the you know ocean of knowledge so please remember your Mantra\n",
    "and we will swim together as they say okay I question yes yeah you said\n",
    "the red pen any particular significance of a red pen it's the instruction that we got you\n",
    "know it's it is uh we say that you know it's a blessing of ganesa when writing\n",
    "you know it is ganesa who wrote everything and he wrote it with his Tusk and with the pen you know color so we we\n",
    "write generally we write Mantra in a red color that's how I've been\n",
    "taught I can see there are some more questions let me answer here so how much homework is is there and what if you\n",
    "can't complete on time the homeworks are there for you you know it's it's not\n",
    "something that we are rigorous about and it's not something that we are going to grade or anything like that but it's a\n",
    "really good idea to do the homework you see there there are levels of um the\n",
    "when we receive the knowledge there are certain stages in which the knowledge behaves you know first we pick up the\n",
    "information we get the information and that is the role of the Moon and then we need to process those informations and\n",
    "then after that we you know some of those you know digest and some of those digested information are stored as a\n",
    "memory and each of these processes has its own you know its own importance but\n",
    "when you do a homework you are applying what you've learned and only when you do\n",
    "a homework will you know exactly what is it how much what is it that you will learn and where you la so homework is\n",
    "kind of like you know self test for you guys you know to see how much you've\n",
    "really learned there's you know in you know as guruji told told me you know\n",
    "once that and to all of us is that only when you teach the knowledge that you\n",
    "really got the knowledge and the reason for that is because only then do you\n",
    "really understand you know how much of it was digested how much was you know\n",
    "kind of you know became second nature to you so homework is for you there is no\n",
    "there we will not put timelines on it but we would really encourage you to uh to finish them and to submit them to us\n",
    "you can submit them on on telegram or if you don't feel comfortable about that we\n",
    "can do that in email you know whatever works for you you can even keep it for yourself but I would really encourage\n",
    "you to do it um so just Jeremy is\n",
    "asking harak Krishna is a kind of par or is par par exact name\n",
    "forna it's not kind of parar manra it is our pararam Mantra it is the Mantra that\n",
    "by which you know Shia chutas has taught the jsh to his\n",
    "disciples and through that line we also go the same Mantra this Mantra can be\n",
    "found in different scriptures as well and this Mantra can also be derived from the parashara as well so this is\n",
    "something that we go go into when we start studying the schloka so there is no kind of it it is parar\n",
    "Mantra okay yeah Nish here one one question uh\n",
    "if I may ask is there uh is there a relationship between the Mantra shastra\n",
    "and J this we are going to learn are they both are independent and we can\n",
    "pursue them independently um they are very much\n",
    "interl you know you can do uh it's you see we learn so much from Mantra shastra\n",
    "uh we learn so much jotish in Mantra shastra and we learn so much mantras by\n",
    "studying jotish and um because mantas is a\n",
    "science that you know it's U it's you know the way uh Guru San is teaching it\n",
    "it's it's again it's everything starts from the sound and everything St starts from The Creation The Very creation and\n",
    "that those the the same principles apply to both it's just that Mantra shastra is\n",
    "very much focused in the focused on the intricacies of you know how the Mantra is built the sounds of the Mantra how\n",
    "you know how many repetition you know when you know dos and don'ts you know\n",
    "what is supposed to be done and what is not supposed to be done and and because you know you know Guru is teaching the\n",
    "Mantra shastra he's always you know teaching us a lot of jotish in that course as well so you don't need manast\n",
    "to to learn jotish that is for sure but if you want to be a practicing jsha and\n",
    "you want to help people with ready remedies then it's really good to know\n",
    "at least some Basics and those B Basics you will get in pjc as\n",
    "well it's just uh you know when we when we say this is something that belongs to mant Shasta it means that you know\n",
    "manast is probably going to be a many year course the way guruji is making it to be so it's um it's just not something\n",
    "that we can like summarize in one sentence so sometimes we are going to tell you you know this is the Mantra we\n",
    "do to remedy this situation and sometimes we'll need to explain to you the mantra for you to better understand\n",
    "you know jotish principles okay okay so we better know\n",
    "jotish before uh at least uh yeah you don't need to know jotish to\n",
    "to join Mantra shter program no you can be yeah no no no I uh there are many\n",
    "people who study Mantra shastra because they are practicing Mantra or they are\n",
    "you know they want that part of the spiritual knowledge you know it's uh it\n",
    "can be it can be separated but it works very very well\n",
    "together it complements each other understood thank you g thank you\n",
    "you're welcome you're welcome I have one question from my side\n",
    "yes uh you have when we start with the Shara actually you have the prayers for\n",
    "the the first chapter is on the prayers for the Vic learning and you have about 13 mantras here 14 sorry 15 mantras here\n",
    "and then you have a sadana document at the at the end and that is on\n",
    "narasimha and I looked at it now these stanas what you expecting us to do is it\n",
    "is besides the which we 108 times right or this is\n",
    "when we start every time we start with the learning we start with this 15 stanas every time\n",
    "or yeah no that that would be too much no what we uh so let's um branka can I\n",
    "yes yeah but that is uh planned for the second webinar yes I I was just about to\n",

    "with the sard for this first year of pjc so that you can read them and prepare your questions for jiko and then jiko is\n",
    "going to clarify everything to you about other mantras you will we will learn a\n",
    "lots and lots of Mantra and you should not feel uh that that this that you\n",
    "there is no expectation of you to practice all of those Mantra right away and all at the same time in fact you\n",
    "know we are taught that one should always have like a one primary focus\n",
    "that doesn't mean drop all the other sard that we are doing if we have already you know our Guru Mantra diction\n",
    "Mantra or meditation or whatever practice that you have it just means that you know we choose one and then\n",
    "until we complete that one that's kind of our main focus but all of those questions will Sho answer u in two weeks\n",
    "in our next webinar uh sorry in continuation to that\n",
    "so there is this narima sadna out over there yes and the guru sadna so the so\n",
    "we are we are advised to start nasima sadna now because uh or is it that we\n",
    "wait till January what is it how does that work the so there is when it comes\n",
    "to narim Kad and it is uh o uh obligatory and you're supposed to do it\n",
    "during this first year now in jelo holds this webinar he's going to explain you\n",
    "all the details about it and help you find you know the recommended mut if you\n",
    "wish to do that if not then you can just simply start whenever you want based on\n",
    "that uh material that you have because guruji kind of did spell out everything you just need to start on a Thursday\n",
    "yeah and follow the guidelines so if you feel you know that you can start already now please go ahead you know there is\n",
    "not we we don't kind of we don't dictate that that's really up to you that's up\n",
    "to students you know it's up to you if you wish or not to do that but that's\n",
    "our recommendation and in those material you can see why G you commend it because I was doing it because I started doing\n",
    "it so yeah yeah just continue please just continue this is more I just\n",
    "started doing it mhm that's great that's really great just continue but we we go\n",
    "through the same order as mentioned in the website is that is what is confusing\n",
    "me because we go through the mantras and then the next where we have about 30\n",
    "audio files from Sanjay Raj and that we go in that order or that is that's my\n",
    "primary question yes about that I'm going to going to share with you or you already know that there are 13 lessons\n",
    "you know and we can also post those links in our telegram so just if there is any confusion but I think that the\n",
    "site is really good in indicating which which lessons belong to which uh module\n",
    "you there is no uh there is no like enforced order when it comes to the lessons you can do it in uh whichever\n",
    "way you want you know it's just those all of those materials sanesi considered\n",
    "important before stepping into the parasa the study of the uh parasa book okay so you\n",
    "know it's a it's up to you and just as I said before you know we you will\n",
    "probably go back to that again and again so for example the foundation the the whole audio the whole day of the uh\n",
    "studying of the foundation that is something that we are going to be doing over and over again just in different\n",
    "context you know in different context we are going to do the lights you know the the rashes and then we going to learn\n",
    "all about the rashes and you know so we expect of you to go through it you know\n",
    "and uh study it and then we are going to take it from there so today is uh about\n",
    "the you know basically kind of like U the housekeeping of the course if you\n",
    "may and then the next week we are going to set up everything that has to do with the Sada recommended Sada if you have\n",
    "not already started if you have just please continue and that is having in mind that you know some of us are uh for\n",
    "for some of us you know this maybe new new material new way of you know sadana\n",
    "and spirituality so that's how that's why we want to explain it and then you know the following webinars there will\n",
    "be you know question answer sessions for the whole of the Shara so we will just\n",
    "let you know when this is happening and what is you know which lessons we are going to be doing so that you can study\n",
    "them prepare your questions and we can go through them and the guru wandana also is\n",
    "something that we are to learn Guru Vandana is Al it's uh so Guru\n",
    "Vandana is one of the guru mantras so it's really you so how to answer this\n",
    "this for example sorry there are 13 stanzas right in that Guru W yeah that's\n",
    "the that's the whole thing is to be uh uh s is it s yeah the whole thing is\n",
    "supposed to be recited in one go that is the guru Vandana so what some do is that\n",
    "you know that is their Guru prayer for the day so you can do Guru Vandana and\n",
    "with that that is your Guru prayer of the day you can do om gurama Mantra and\n",
    "that is your prayer for the guru for the day for example this is something that I do when you when I open the chart or\n",
    "when I prepare the chart or something this is the Mantra that I do personally you're going to learn a lot of other\n",
    "Guru mantras you know throughout the course so with time we are also going to suggest to you based on your chart what\n",
    "could be the best match for you but right now you know that Guru Vandana is\n",
    "a form of a prayer to a guru it's obedience to you know you know bowing down to Guru respecting the guru you you\n",
    "can do the same with om gur uh and that this is to be separate\n",
    "for the parar Mantra parar Mantra is just something that needs to flow through you daily so that's why we say\n",
    "this is just you know everyday practice it's just not even computed in anything else if I can say it like\n",
    "that so basically your we can learn it but because it's not easy with almost\n",
    "about 15 16 stanzas yeah recitation and all yeah so I mean it's not that\n",
    "necessary that we have to do it every day now we can learn it over a period of time yes you can learn it over the\n",
    "period of time and you know it's it's a prayer to Guru you can choose a different prayer to Guru but it's offer\n",
    "to you there because this is something that we we uh do Guru vand is something that is done in the paramaras so for\n",
    "example when I was initiated in meditation at the initiation this was\n",
    "sung you know the whole Guru Vandana and by priest of course so you know it's a good idea to to learn it it's very\n",
    "soothing it's very nice to recite but that's something that you know when you when you wish to take upon yourself you\n",
    "can practice and at the same time listen to guru's\n",
    "recording M okay uh is there already a date for\n",
    "the contact course so Thea how it's being done in our tradition that each\n",
    "aha date for the contact course no we don't have a date for the contact course\n",
    "we are waiting for all of those um practicalities about the contact\n",
    "course uh because of several things one is that you know we our enrollment period is still open it's going to be\n",
    "open until the end of December so we still don't know the how many students are joining and of those students who\n",
    "are joining we don't know how many students are interested in contact course so once we really start you know\n",
    "officially the course you know we are going to send those questions out to know how many of you wish to be present\n",
    "at the contact course uh this contact course is not obligatory and it's kind\n",
    "of uh it's really up to you you are very much encouraged to come you\n",
    "know at least for some of the years that we hope to spend\n",
    "together um but you know we don't have those information also it's it's a bit difficult to plan right now with\n",
    "pandemic and with the rules changing all the time so it's kind of like it's a bit of a waiting game right now but\n",
    "traditionally contact course is uh uh is normally done around uh September\n",
    "October so we plan to uh our webinars to cover\n",
    "you know because we have two webinars each month to cover each of the modules you know throughout through those and\n",
    "through our webinars and for those modules that are a bit more you know content heavy we're going to organize\n",
    "few for those who are really small and short and we can teach in one webinar we\n",
    "are going to do that so we hope to do as much as we can of the you know pjc until\n",
    "we to meet in person and then during that period we have a selected amount of\n",
    "lessons that are meant to be uh you know taught in person or that we didn't cover\n",
    "throughout the year so that's kind of how how we do\n",
    "it yeah okay guys so we if you don't have any more\n",

    "medical astrology so and during this you know this\n",
    "housekeeping part of the webinar i'm going to be addressing many of your questions that\n",
    "you had on the telegram so some things are just simply easier to to talk about than just to\n",
    "write about so first things first you know um our our daily our our tool\n",
    "for a daily question answer sessions and guidelines you know where can i come in and vergie comes in every\n",
    "once in a while is our telegram group and i am really it's a fantastic thing to see\n",
    "how much you are helping each other and i just want to say you know it's really you know heartwarming to see\n",
    "that and please continue with that you know you're gonna learn you're gonna grow\n",
    "from that and your you know guru buys will be you know will benefit from that that\n",
    "being said you know we do we do have a few things to mention uh uh number one is that that we are gonna\n",
    "follow the syllables you know we are gonna follow the modules as they are meant to be\n",
    "covered that you know you can see on our website so we do that for several reasons but the\n",
    "main one is that we have a focused study on that module you know\n",
    "you know we are a big group you know and some are beginners you know with just\n",
    "some basic knowledge and they're looking forward to start you know and to learn you know systematically and some are\n",
    "advanced so for those who are advanced they are free to you know explore all\n",
    "the materials that are there but in our mentors you know mentor mentorship part in our telegram please\n",
    "you know keep uh you know keep to the module that we are currently covering also that way when you go back\n",
    "to those webinars you are going to know exactly where to look for those answers um so that would be\n",
    "number one another thing really important is that you know some some of you mentioned that maybe there\n",
    "will be a better software to use for this purpose the uh you know guruji chose telegram and he\n",
    "uses telegram for all his courses so i we have a full trust that that's gonna work for us as well\n",
    "and uh use telegram as a tool you know like just like anything on the internet\n",
    "any type of software it's not yours so don't count on that being there for you\n",
    "uh for knowledge please take your own notes this is just something that helps helps\n",
    "us so telegram was never the point the knowledge is the point so as we send you uh some files and share files please\n",
    "download them and organize them as you know pjc year one or something like that\n",
    "and um and the question answers the principles that we share that you think\n",
    "you will benefit from write them down in your notebooks that's the only thing that's really yours because just like with the flash that we\n",
    "have situation and most of the internet has the same thing a hurdle so is telegram you know telegram can be\n",
    "erased and it can be changed and algorithm can be changed so don't rely on that it's just a tool let's learn let's\n",
    "communicate through it but have your own notes\n",
    "[Music] what else about the telegram so i mentioned that we should stick to\n",
    "the syllables i mentioned that we're going to keep with the with the telegram and you know we need to have our own\n",
    "notes also yeah the important thing is when you when you are writing your questions\n",
    "be very intentional about what you writing you know what you're asking you know\n",
    "don't have uh you know and that way it's gonna serve you the best\n",
    "if you know what you studied you studied something and then you have a doubt or you need\n",
    "some clarification ask very intentionally as a closed\n",
    "question as opposed to you know can you tell us something more or can you expand on something\n",
    "because we definitely can but we don't know what you are asking until you know we read it very nicely\n",
    "written this is also a really good exercise in learning jotish because as guruji said very nicely you\n",
    "know if you don't receive the if you don't have the right information\n",
    "you know you cannot get to the right conclusions and if you don't and and then the third step is the right\n",
    "application so be very intentional about the information that you're receiving the conclusions\n",
    "that you are you know you know making out of those and then ask us questions and that way we can\n",
    "really you know help you the best you know yeah i can i can give you just\n",
    "a small\n",
    "i can give you just the small example of this there was a question on telegram\n",
    "about the devatas about the indra talking with the when afflicted guru is giving the the\n",
    "problems with the brain so there was a speak about adi\n",
    "you know it's not it's not a problem for me to listen\n",
    "those things in actual usage you know that's why the the\n",
    "work anything unless we know exactly what will pratyadi devatas do and that will be that's why we are\n",
    "focusing on following the modules because when that modules came all of those things will be explained\n",
    "okay just that example that we had on telegram yeah yeah okay um\n",
    "yes okay okay perfect um yeah it's very true you know uh that the\n",
    "the event or you know the advantages can i have is that you know we know where we are heading\n",
    "and because when when we know where we are heading we want to like kind of guide you through that process so you\n",
    "don't take too big of a bite of things and then get indigestion from that you know every every module\n",
    "needs its time and we are just starting and it's a five year course and even this\n",
    "first year is huge you know and uh it's really an ocean of knowledge\n",
    "there is really no better you know expression for it so for really us to grasp\n",
    "so what we are going to be doing during this first year we are going to be learning and\n",
    "understanding the the elements that we are going to be using from now on\n",
    "and each of those elements we can deepen the other the understanding you know so we want to\n",
    "really you know give it give it give to each topic the time that it needs you know and\n",
    "also the second thing is you know we're gonna be kind of teaching you how to learn so once we are\n",
    "not together anymore and you don't have a direct access to the mentors you will be able to find those same\n",
    "answers you will be able to apply that same logic and those same steps so for example which is very there is\n",
    "something very typical uh for our tradition or at least that's something how i learned from guruji\n",
    "and you can see who learned from guruji is that you know he starts with the name you know he says\n",
    "you know you know he's not talking about parivartana yoga let's say from what does it mean and what does you\n",
    "know what does it imply he starts by you know what is yoga and then he says what is parivartana and\n",
    "what does parivartana mean and once he completely you know explained all those steps\n",
    "then he says so in the chart these are the combinations and out of those combinations these are\n",
    "the effects without that you know you are kind of missing this crucial part and that is\n",
    "that you know from now on you will be able to stand on your own two feet\n",
    "without us there so when you get the the question you know you will be at least you'll\n",
    "have a very clear idea on you know can this even be you know for example\n",
    "i've i've noticed you know on forums you can find a typical example of that and that is you know somebody asking you know\n",
    "you know can ketu have a drishti and then the answers are yes or no or this and that and this and that\n",
    "that's not the question question is what is ketu and what is drishti and then explain from there you already\n",
    "have the answer there is really no it's not like opinion it's the fact it's the logic it's the\n",
    "derivation so that's really what what i mean i'm explaining this just so you know that we are not\n",
    "cutting some of your of your questions because we don't know don't want to encourage you it's only\n",
    "because that you know it's gonna benefit you on the long run okay um so that was about the syllabus\n",
    "now when we are on the topic of you know tools and technology and all this you probably noticed that you know the\n",
    "flash adobe flash has run out and we already have all those materials\n",
    "ready we are just waiting you know for uh for it to be implemented so you have an access\n",
    "right now it's probably like you know different for everyone for example me personally i can still access all the\n",
    "audios but then some of you will not be able and people not just us you know people\n",
    "in general are trying to figure it out and they're already software's to bridge that so just give it a bit of time you know\n",
    "i'm sure in a few days we'll have the system you know that's going to work for us until then we have plenty of material to\n",
    "go after and you know we're going to be fine just some patients\n",
    "anyway these these lectures now will be foundation and for\n",
    "the next webinar will be uh about the calendar\n",
    "so all of those lessons are in pdf on the website yeah yeah so for next two webinars to be\n",
    "prepared you you don't you don't need to uh these slides but anyway that we are giving our best\n",
    "to for them to be as soon as possible yeah\n",
    "and and people are talking about the things i'm hoping to happen soon\n",
    "just so you know especially for those who have joined us recently and in the recent a few days you know it could be kind of a shock\n",
    "like you know this is the website these are the materials and yet i cannot you know access them so please bear with\n",
    "us you know it's all happening uh then about the webinars you know you\n",
    "uh should all have links to our webinars it's a private youtube channel you know and uh\n",
    "jco has you have con you have been asked to contact jacob so you can get those links\n",
    "we will be storing all our webinars in that same place so that you can refer refer to them and\n",
    "they're going to be forever yours you know we you know there is no like end date to\n",
    "that whilst for our pjc material you should know that you know for the first year you have two year access to all the\n",
    "materials after which you know one can extend it and i think there is some some symbolic fee for that i don't know\n",
    "how much at the moment but just so you have like a an idea time idea about all these things\n",
    "and um what else what what else is important\n",
    "it's important to say that both sherika and myself you know english is not our mother tongue i'm\n",
    "sure you're gonna all be surprised now so if you don't understand something and\n",
    "or if it's you know you know influencing you in your studies or something just write to us write to us privately\n",
    "you know you can always write to us you know we are going to address them you know and uh i know it never bothered\n",
    "me when i studied something so i hope you you know it will be same for you but at the same time i know we have all different\n",
    "sensibilities about the language and a spoken word so don't be\n",
    "shy to call us on that and or write to us or clarify something it's all good we are\n",
    "two donuts you know we can take a lot so feel free\n",
    "to just shoot you know and um so let me see what else i have a few\n",
    "notes so we have covered everything that you asked about uh yeah there is one thing about the\n",
    "structure of the course that can probably ease your mind a bit and that is\n",
    "you have probably noticed we we referred you to a ramba module which is which are pre-lessons and the\n",
    "philosophy that material is in our tradition is normally it's not\n",
    "it's normally it's traditionally not studied first in fact normally we start with the third\n",
    "chapter of bright parashara horoshastra we start with the grahas and the rashes and you\n",
    "know those things we don't start with this and you know we do\n",
    "the whole circle third chapter and all the chapters and then we come back to study the creation\n",
    "and avatars and that's because those two are considered advanced level and they\n",
    "are absolutely advanced so if i hope you know some of you wrote to\n",
    "us or to me anyway that um they felt very uh like frightened you know and you know\n",
    "overwhelmed by the material and what do i do with this you know this you know somebody wrote to me it looks\n",
    "like an epic epic work like mahabharat you know what how do i start that and i want to tell\n",
    "you that you know um first that material is something that we all after so many years of study come\n",
    "back to and how we come back to we learn the rashi and then something from\n",
    "from the uh creation gets to be understood again we'll learn the grahas and then we re when we read that and you know and even\n",
    "you know we we studied you know so many courses you know germany course and mantra shasta now and i still come back\n",
    "and get the new understanding of what is it that's being talked to so that preparatory part is there for\n",
    "our online version of the course it's there so you have like you know an overview of you know what is it that you\n",
    "know we are covering here and we are covering a lot so it's not a mathematical school module where you know\n",
    "you're starting with one plus one is two and then you build up on that you know we are starting from\n",
    "unmanifested lord so it's not from simplicity that you're starting we are starting from you know\n",
    "like in a clear overview what is it that we are going to be talking about what is it that you know\n",
    "where we are starting you know it's just needed there for this form of teaching but don't fear\n",
    "don't think that just because we are finishing you know after next webinar you're going to be\n",
    "finishing with a ramba in our conversation about that it's not as it's not like you know you\n",
    "need to know that to continue you need to be informed about that\n",
    "and then are things that we will be talking uh talking about today next time about the time so today about\n",
    "the foundations those are the i'm gonna make a summary of the things that you should know\n",
    "and take with you for the next level you know the summary of the things and then for all the philosophical part\n",
    "you can come back to because the philosophy it depends on on on uh on the book that you're studying\n",
    "you know it depends on the spiritual lineage that you are following it depends on so many\n",
    "things so it can be explained in many different ways i think one of you also said that very nicely in the telegram group as a group\n",
    "as they they listened to guruji's talk about the creation several times and each time it was different and each time\n",
    "they'll learn something new so that's the type of the material so if this is going to bring you ease\n",
    "i'm very happy about that so just so you know what what it is you don't need to\n",
    "know it like one one of you guys uh asked me if they needed to know\n",
    "um the whole stortra that we are doing with sri ganaraj sadhana by hand and we don't you know just like with any\n",
    "sadhana we we first say the mantra we speak the mantra that's called\n",
    "you know vacha you know we speak and then when we learn it we can start you know just\n",
    "moving our mouth our mouth so you know others don't hear and then we can go to the mental mantra\n",
    "so that's the system um is time flying\n",
    "okay so there are questions let me check the question so i'm sure you have\n",
    "okie dokie\n",

    "sanskrit as there is literature in sanskrit\n",
    "who um also for mantra it's useful to ensure we pronounce it correctly\n",
    "so here's how you know other batches do this thing you know but shirkku and i are not experts in sanskrit so each batch of a\n",
    "pjc had a like you know either they had\n",
    "somebody in a group who was really good and they helped each other that way all for example guruji mentioned one of the\n",
    "one of the teachers one uh that is uh she is doing you know she's lecturing\n",
    "and at the university and she also does a private classes and she was also available to uh\n",
    "to respond to our needs you know so we always have a you know outside source to\n",
    "help us with that so if any of you have that expertise as in you know\n",
    "we are confident that you can help each other you know pronouncing the mantra correctly\n",
    "that you should you know you should let us know you should let us know in a telegram group so that you know we can\n",
    "refer to you so you can help out you know it can only benefit you so that's about the sanskrit and it\n",
    "also goes for all the other you know how do you call that uh all the other\n",
    "subjects and all the other topics that are you know that we touch upon but they're really not a part of fora\n",
    "shastra what we are studying so for example there was a talk about astronomy so what we can do\n",
    "we can tell you this is the book that you know we we you know in our tradition we refer to and that surah siddhanta\n",
    "but you know we are not going to be teaching on that we are not going to you know there is no material in our course on that okay so that's a different\n",

    "it's a good thing you are asking me because in fact i i made a note about that about you had\n",
    "many many questions about the spiritual sadhana and various aspects of of this and i\n",
    "remember myself and i started learning jyotish and started you know you know practicing sadness\n",
    "i had a kind of a fear i i had a fear of like you know making a mistake and i\n",
    "would really like you to not start with that you know you know the the fear is not needed\n",
    "we we follow what is written and to our best understanding and follow\n",
    "follow what is there and we put the best foot forward and we have a clean heart an open heart\n",
    "and then we learn as we go we improve as we go in and it should never be a fear we\n",
    "approaching a god we are asking for the knowledge we are asking for a spiritual believement you know we are asking for all this good\n",
    "thing there is no reason to have a fear about that what what is what we strive for is you know being\n",
    "ideal but that's again that's astra that would be a different anger of the vedas so we know our limits\n",
    "you know and if you if some of you are very specific about that and want to\n",
    "know very specific things about that write to us and we are going to learn you know where to send you how to learn\n",
    "those things um so let's see other questions\n",
    "naresh is asking is we are going to learn vast content and best practice you can suggest to\n",
    "memorize what we are learning in each class you can share your experience as a student will also be helpful\n",
    "um so what guruji gave us at the beginning\n",
    "is guru vandana and guru vandana is a beautiful thing to to learn to recite and even though you\n",
    "will stumble with your tongue at the to begin with especially if you're if you're not you know trained that way or if you're\n",
    "in a from a foreign country you know it's a beautiful thing and it gives you that sharpness that is needed\n",
    "so it's a it's a really nice practice to start your day with that so what i do i don't consider it as my\n",
    "you know primary you know sit down in front of alter you know spiritual sadhana what i do is that when i sit in front of computer\n",
    "to do or write or teach or something then i recite it you know that's one\n",
    "thing another thing is guru mantra and but more than anything else it's a parampara mantra\n",
    "and the way how parampara mantra works is not you know you're suddenly very extremely sharp it was that you know\n",
    "everything around you is your is your guru you know you're gonna find the answers you know\n",
    "you're gonna get the answers you know and it's it it remedies you know later on we are going to be\n",
    "learning deeper about the pramper mantra but it's going to its remedies are shadripus it increases the\n",
    "gunas and with that you know you are going to know how and where and and you you're going to be\n",
    "the best thing that guruji said is that you know jyotish jyotish is life so please have this you know you know\n",
    "it's a good idea to understand that you know jyotish is not something we do in front of the computer jyotishi's life\n",
    "you know and everybody and all the situations and all the people they're our teachers so if you have the\n",
    "gunas you know the good gunas as we say that come from reciting of that mantra you\n",
    "know people and situations and animals and all sorts of dreams are gonna come to you to teach\n",
    "you so i hope this helps otherwise yeah sorry\n",
    "just to mention that also\n",
    "i'm sorry for this uh i just said uh like in first year it it was given ghana\n",
    "rajasthan and srinagar for every uh next year will be new southerners and\n",
    "mantras to be done that will help you to to learn the knowledge that is given\n",
    "okay okay thank you for noticing that if you\n",
    "were both like you know it makes perfect sense i can hear him\n",
    "um okay so time is flying i'm gonna be answering all those other\n",
    "questions you know in in a forum or if we have some time at the end but what we wanted to do\n",
    "today is also a bit of your t-shirt don't you think so let's let's do that\n",
    "i'm gonna just start you know screen\n",
    "sharing\n",
    "is can you all see the the slides\n",
    "yeah you can all see the slides okay perfect so after you've studied that long lesson\n",
    "on a foundation of vedic astrology there is one thing i you know we really\n",
    "hope that you got from that lesson\n",
    "i'm sorry i just need to mute somebody's speaking to\n",
    "[Music]\n",
    "i can still hear some people\n",
    "okay perfect i did so the one thing i hope you got from this lesson\n",
    "is that what is jotish you know and you know some of you also had a\n",
    "question you know which was really you know meant to be answered with this question and that is who can study jotis\n",
    "you know can a person who is not you know from the tradition or from the uh uh you know growing up on in india\n",
    "or you know from wherever in the world can they study it and the answer is really you know in in\n",
    "the answer to the question what is the otis so we know that jyotish as a word is composed of jyoti which\n",
    "means the light and isha which refers to ishana or one of the aspects of shiva that has\n",
    "a third eye has the knowledge of the of the uh of the third eye the spiritual knowledge\n",
    "so that is how we define jyotish but to have that knowledge of the god or\n",
    "of the mind question is what do we use so many people they you know they focus\n",
    "on the rushes or they focus on the grahas and the yogas and the dashes and different techniques but guruji in this\n",
    "lesson he explains you know jyotish is the study of the 33 devas\n",
    "and then how how does those two things correlate just a second yeah so he says you know which are those\n",
    "33 devas so i won't be repeating the whole lesson you know kuroji did it best\n",
    "you know and we don't have time to repeat the whole thing but i want to give you some insight as to how and\n",
    "why and how we are going to be studying this in the jotis so the first one the first part of the\n",
    "33 deva is is astava or the eight vassals or the eight lights\n",
    "and those eight lights are you know sun and the moon which are also called you know\n",
    "luminaries you know we will all often find the reference to them as luminaries\n",
    "because they are considered to be the original light now many you know many of you can be\n",
    "start you know can be uh questioning this as in you know we know that it's only the sun that has\n",
    "a light and moon has only the reflected light but what guruji explains is that you\n",
    "know those two you know those two sources of light they're still sources of light and they\n",
    "are here you know for the for a very long period of time\n",
    "and you know they are both you know light givers so we consider them as a as a mother and\n",
    "a father or as a father and a mother you know as you know sky father and earth mother there are many references\n",
    "to these so those are two original lights or the light givers and then we have you know five what is\n",
    "called tatwa planets so then you can ask yourself you know or at least i asked myself you know if\n",
    "these five are not lights how come they're in the i asked the vessels you know and\n",
    "then we learned they are the they are still the devas but they they'll they teach us and they give us the\n",
    "knowledge it's based on the tatwa so they are you know so every time when\n",
    "we talk about uh let's say in a very practical you know terminology when it comes to jotis\n",
    "every time when we talk about the profession of the teacher we know that we are talking about the jupiter you know\n",
    "so we we connect that every time we talk about the health issue we know to which planet to go so that\n",
    "knowing where to look is the deva gives giving us the knowledge it's just that\n",
    "these five planets they give us that knowledge through their tatwa through their you know physical\n",
    "existence that is you know the the the you know that you know let's say for example if\n",
    "you start from the beginning mars oh i see some s missing but mars being representing the agni data\n",
    "so we know that you know if we are looking for the energy part of you know our our system you know we are\n",
    "going to be looking for the mars we know if we are going to look for the nervous system we are going to check if mars is\n",
    "afflicted we know if we are talking about the engineering we are going to be looking for the mass\n",
    "so that's the way how we are getting the knowledge from these five total planets\n",
    "now the second question that you may have is that you know how you know we know that the sun is the agony and then the mars is the agni\n",
    "you know so how do we combine these two together and then guruji explains you know it's\n",
    "uh there are two qualities with the agni and one is the light and another one is\n",
    "the fire so when we talk about the sun as being the ruler\n",
    "of the agni tatwa we are talking about that light this satwaguna you know he is the\n",
    "primary light giver but when we talk about the mars we are talking about the fire\n",
    "same comes with you know with the moon and the sukra so the order of those planets are you know\n",
    "the the the tatwas related to these planets are as i said you know mars agni\n",
    "mercur and mercury is pretty or buddha i will be using both sanskrit and english you know jupiter is akash venus is jalla\n",
    "and saturn is value and so what does saturn teach us for just for example so certainty teaches us\n",
    "that you know that first because he is ruling air or the value\n",
    "and you know that's in our physical existence that's the movement and that's the breeding you know we know\n",
    "that saturn should be consulted when we are learning different yogas for longevity\n",
    "in fact there are different pairs for studying longevity one of them being the moon and the saturn both having the value in them\n",
    "so and now we know that for example if saturn is the problem what do we need to do we advise the\n",
    "pranayama you know as that is the way to remedy the saturn so this is how these five planets which\n",
    "are represented five tatwas you know are you know teaching us different things\n",
    "you know so i i've written here that panchata for planets offer knowledge of the five states of being\n",
    "you know so in their showing kind of you know increasing decrease decrease like what we talked about you\n",
    "know jupiter being you know debilitated right now you know it's an it's a decrease of\n",
    "akras it's a decrease of that magnetism of it's a decrease of you know\n",
    "being us being together you know and um and then finally you know those\n",
    "are the seven and the eighth one is the nakshatra and guruji makes a very nice reference he says you know\n",
    "nakshatras or stars you know the constellations you know krishna dances among the stars\n",
    "in you know nakshatras as such will show more of the mental desires\n",
    "and emotional states and this is something we are going to go deeper into the modules when we study the akshatras\n",
    "so really when guruji is talking about the astava what i would really like you to get from\n",
    "this is that this is not a philosophy this is what we are looking in the\n",
    "charts in the horoscopes so these are those devas those light\n",
    "givers and by light givers i mean knowledge givers that are gonna show us everything in the horoscope\n",
    "and these are the first eight so right now you know so at this moment it's not like you know uh jo\n",
    "in jotis we'll learn about the nine grahas and the twelve rushes no we are too we are learning about the\n",
    "god and the way we are learning about the god and the way we are getting the knowledge and\n",
    "enlightenment about the nature of the god is through these 33.\n",
    "then the the second part of these 33 devas is a kadash so as always you know guruji would start\n",
    "and say you know rudra comes from the root word which means to cry to be grief\n",
    "and pain and all these things and all those things that come upon separation\n",
    "you know once we get separate from our loved ones when there is a death then we\n",
    "cry you know the separation gives crying so the ekadasha rudra they address those\n",
    "destruction uh energies in a horoscope you know so here it says you know ten of\n",
    "those rudras are responsible for holding the prana or the vital life force or air\n",
    "within the body once the eleventh one is responsible for your soul you know uh for your specific soul and\n",
    "it is calculated from the atmakaraka planet so during the pressure during the\n",
    "parashara course that we are studying this year um we are going to be mentioning aspects of\n",
    "rudra first when we start talking about the bubbles then you're going to learn that\n",
    "there are certain bhavas that are called rudrabawas and those rudrabawas are those who can\n",
    "end the life or you know they can threaten the longevity so that will be like the first\n",
    "first glance of where we are learning about the rudras and then when we lay in a different year of\n",
    "parashara i believe that's a second to last year parashara when we go in that about the atma karaka and all\n",
    "about the soul and all about the atma we are also be covering you know the uh maheshwara is what\n",
    "how do we define maheshwara what does maheshwara do and how all these things happen but at the moment if you want to learn\n",
    "more about the rudas if you're really interested in that um guruji's translation and commentary\n",
    "on jaminio podesha sutras covers that and guruji's course in germany podesha sutras there we've learned to identify\n",
    "them name them and see different natures and do remedies out of that but just so you\n",
    "know that you know the you know this is not feel it's a philosophy but then it's applied\n",
    "philosophy as soon as we enter the the subject\n",
    "i've written a few things so maybe we should rely on that he says vadasa or vadasa or tvaladitias are the 12 months\n",
    "represented by the represented the 12 signs in the zodiac so from geocentrical point of view\n",
    "we see that sun is moving even though that's not the true but looking from the earth up we can see the sun moving and sun being\n",
    "the agni tatwa he has this power that from each you know for each time when he joins the moon\n",
    "till next time that he comes to join moon it's just below 30 days 29.5 so we\n",
    "rounded out that to be a 30 degree period and that period until his next time with\n",
    "the moon you know uh it's counted as a month and it's counted as a rashi\n",
    "now this is why we call that vada shadita having and fellow rushes addressing both space and time you know\n",
    "we are we are looking for the space in degrees about from uh uh related to the sun's\n",
    "movement and then we are also measuring the time that is needed so what vadesa details are really doing\n",
    "and what 12 rushes are doing you know when we look at the chart 12 rushes are showing\n",
    "all material resources that we can see experience that we can think of so every\n",
    "everything that can be find you know is uh 12 rushes and the givers the davos\n",
    "behind that advancer details\n",
    "and the reason why you know these portions are you know cut in such a way is because you know it\n",
    "is the sun's movement that we are measuring really and sun being the agni tatwa he makes\n",
    "these slices very nice slices so they when you're talking about the agony then you learn that you know for example\n",
    "knife is related to the agni planets and he is just you know cutting\n",
    "those portions into 12 so that we have a circle of three 360 degrees and twelve\n",
    "rashes zodiac\n",
    "so anything that we associate on this earth is from russia and all resources are given by the adityas\n",
    "then you know you can ask yourself so what about the babas you know now that we slice this on you know in a fellow russians you know\n",
    "and we follow russia's to define the bhavas something that is not the only\n",
    "definition of baba and we are going to be covering that in a baba module but now that we know that you know you\n",
    "can ask yourself what is baba and baba in truth is just our thoughts about the different aspects of life\n",
    "you know it's the bhava it's the state you know how do we think about something you know\n",
    "how is our brain when it comes to ourselves you know the first house you know what do we how what do we think about\n",
    "the cells what do we think about our family our money our sustenance in the second house and like that we go through\n",
    "the so it's the the up the our state and our thoughts about these things\n",
    "so for example often astrologers would say for example find the uh\n",
    "profession from the tenth house but in truth the 10th house is really just how do you work but how to find a\n",
    "profession is a very different thing altogether so i hope this clarifies i've noticed\n",
    "this morning that guruji was also talking a bit about aditya's and i made one slide that just\n",
    "lists them so each aditya with the sun entry into a certain sign that's a beginning when that topic comes\n",
    "then we are gonna have a resources to back up our story you know about the adidas um\n",
    "just to give you some some information about where you can learn about that already now uh in mantra shasta course\n",
    "guruji have has covered all of the adidas um [Music]\n",
    "yeah that's one of the best resources vedic remedies his book guruji's book\n",
    "vedic remedies remedies yeah vedic remedies in astrology he also covers some part of aditya but\n",
    "for the purpose of the remedies of chart\n",
    "so how many did we did we have so we had eight vessels so those are the uh the uh uh seven\n",
    "planets plus the nakshatra then we have 12 adityas\n",
    "we have 11 rudras and then there are two more to complete our 33 deva and those are\n",
    "indra and prajapati and so\n",
    "some of you have so let me start with the slide and then i'm going to address the questions that you had so this is guruji explains how this is\n",
    "the fourth principle of jotish and it's called uh and prajapati refers to the lagna\n",
    "because prajapatis are our creators or our progenitors\n",
    "and you know the creation of anybody is really the lagna so when we were created it was indicated\n",
    "by the lagna and we were created by the joining of the sun and the moon the sky\n",
    "father or the rising sun and the earth mother the ecliptic that is the definition of the ascendant\n",
    "so that was our birth so in truth you know you and me\n",
    "and everything that is created is a child of the sky father and earth mother\n",
    "it's the fruit and as such you know the uh we we are gifts and we praise the\n",
    "lagna so we praise the progenitors we praise those who have created us and who have come before us\n",
    "and we do that with the gayatri mantra firstly we got him until he's praised the rising\n",
    "sun who is the giver of the light and the start of everything and then we praise progenitors as well and that is\n",
    "the concept of the first house and then the indra is related\n",
    "so so that's the first house and the indra is related to the 10th house and um indra is the king of the indriyas\n",
    "so when we talk about the throne of the 10th house we talk about indra being the king of\n",
    "the indriyas so there are different types of thrones in a chart so i don't want to and you'll probably\n",
    "have this confusion as in how come we see the throne in a different aspects of the chart\n",

    "material worlds and those being the buloka or earth and then after above that is bubaloka\n",
    "all the solar system where the sun and so the whole soul all the planets are and then after that that comes swagaloka\n",
    "or the sky so those are the three worlds those are the three material worlds that we are\n",

    "those are also the three steps that vishnu has uh taken you know\n",
    "are the three steps of the vishnu in his creation of these worlds and you know um\n",
    "there's a beautiful hymn you know from ringweather saying um\n",
    "you know how you know vishnu does this in his three steps you know and we are going to use this principle\n",
    "later on for example when defining the gandantas and so many other things\n",
    "so it's good to know that it's good to know that we are on the buloka just if there was any doubt we are right\n",
    "there above us is the whole solar system so the sun and all the other planets\n",
    "and then comes swaga which are all the nakshatras and all all the constellations so when we\n",
    "uh it is us who look from the bottom up and you know it's not that you know that\n",
    "you know where we are the the rashes are the one who are creating the nakshatras\n",
    "it is the nakshatras through which we filter the you know the rushes and the planets are\n",
    "moving through them you know so the the the truth is from up down but what we are\n",
    "seeing and perceiving is from the bulk or from the bottom up\n",

    "and seven of those are in a dark side and we call them tala and seven of those are in a visible side and those are the\n",
    "the lokas or the higher worlds so the first one is the buloka where we are\n",
    "and then bubaloka and swagaloka so those are the seventh mapping into seventh eighth in the ninth house\n",
    "and then comes the mahaloka janalo katapaloka in satyaloka which is\n",
    "considered to be in the head now i won't be entering into details about that because there is so much more\n",
    "to that next to that there are seven chakras and next to that there are seven planets lording them and then next to that is\n",
    "the whole creation process you know us coming really intrude from the top down\n",
    "as a beam of light going through all these loka until we land on the on the buloka but that's the that's the\n",
    "philosophy that's not covered here so here i just mentioned that how first and seventh are\n",
    "those satya pita so for where we are in the buloka you know this is the satya\n",
    "and or this is the truth and the truth is that those who have been given birth are also going to die because that is\n",
    "the rule that you know those are the rules that are uh that are guiding the\n",

    "lists depending on the source and depending of the purpose and depending on the you know the\n",
    "the context behind it but this is something that you have been talking about\n",
    "so that that's it that's all that i had uh for today um many of these things you\n",
    "know just about the uh subter issues and topics like that no many of those are given to you for\n",
    "example guruji the way guruji teaches is he gives you the question so that you can go and uh research on\n",
    "that and create your own conclusions about that and then as you learn you're gonna\n",
    "adjust you're gonna add you know you're gonna cut out the things that you didn't get it right and then\n",
    "we are going to when that topic becomes relevant we are going to take it and you know\n",
    "bring some you know clarity to final clarity to it okay guys you know i'm gonna check chat\n",
    "right now just to see if there's something\n",
    "i'm gonna stop sharing let me just say these questions quickly\n",
    "i know we are we have passed the hour but we can give ourselves three more minutes\n",
    "so guru ji shankar is saying guruji in the telegram sanji jiri first aquarius\n",
    "as vishnu aditya hence i was confused uh vishnu aditya is\n",
    "minarashi sun in minarashi so i'll need to read that maybe there is a context\n",
    "that i didn't get should it continue [Music] you need to meet unmute\n",
    "yeah gurus it says that sun in capricorn is\n",
    "is the that because of the worship of the shiva is happening when the\n",
    "when the sun enters but then he said that amongst the uh amongst the the\n",
    "all adityas the vishnu is the strongest and that's why that what branca was mentioning that\n",
    "vishnu is the youngest but the\n",
    "is important which is in the 11th house or kumbharashi okay\n",
    "and krishna was glorifying and the sun inside the kumba\n",
    "okay okay thanks those are the things i didn't manage to read so so naresh is asking namaste guruji if\n",
    "sky father is one of the vada sadityas then who is earth mother so when i was talking about sky father\n",
    "and earth mother i was talking about the the the meeting point of the sun as a\n",
    "sky father and the earth as an earth mother but there are similar references to\n",
    "skyfat and earth by mother being the sun and the moon you know the celestial parents\n",
    "you know so depending on the on the context that we are talking about\n",
    "so biba is asking brankaji how is shani connected to vasishta isn't\n",
    "he surya putra and lineage of kashab oh there's so much good work on that in\n",
    "guruji's book brihat nakshatra um i think we should take that then to\n",
    "explain you know how you know how this um\n",
    "how this came to be i guess then naresh is asking uh just to to\n",
    "finish on this is a book that i hope you all have\n",
    "and uh and we are going to be using using it a lot when we come to the\n",
    "module nakshatras you know we are we're going to be using the audios that guruji have\n",
    "has given and then the book supplementing and in that book there are so many beautiful\n",
    "chapters on the rishis and specifically on supter issues and on the movement of the time\n",
    "and uh so you will you will benefit greatly if you have that book\n",
    "one is the significance related to the rishi and the other is the gothra that is\n",
    "belong to can you hear\n",
    "me okay so naresh is asking um baba is fundamentally taught thought or\n",
    "a state or then there are quite a few definitions we're going to get into that how we think yeah russia is actually what we have\n",
    "physically is my understanding correct yeah russia is a material resource\n",
    "resource so yes\n",
    "[Music] there is a link\n",
    "so arjun is asking so russia shows how we are thinking about the things represented about the baba is placed in\n",
    "uh not really um you we are gonna this is one of the reasons\n",
    "why we need why we should go module after module because we are going to be adding the\n",
    "layers it's not it's not all together you know we are right now what's happening you know you're just you know\n",
    "gelling everything you know there is above and then there is a russian maybe there is a graha and you know so all this shows how i think\n",
    "it doesn't work like that so we are going to get into that you what you should know about the russia is right now russia means a heap\n",
    "quantity of something you know quantity or something so the rashi is really the heap and\n",
    "of everything material the bhavas the way they are defined is\n",
    "how we think about that how we perceive that and when we go into about a module then\n",
    "we are going to learn that there are different bhava uh uh different baba approaches\n",
    "you know and each of that you know there is a bower chakra there is a baba charlie chakra and there are different ways how we are see\n",
    "things and sometimes those things that we are seeing those those things that are happening and sometimes\n",
    "those things that we see we see is our perception and that's the difference between\n",
    "different the chakras baba chakras so that is why i would rather not get\n",
    "into that um shankar shankara trey is asking i\n",
    "have an english translation of b uh parashara is that sufficient or does one\n",
    "need to have the sanskrit version if you have a sanskrit word we generally\n",
    "always advise for any of the works to have a sanskrit version with itrans and translation and commentaries\n",
    "because it's specifically in parashara the present version of parashara is not in all\n",
    "aspects translated the best and guruji addressed that through through as we go through the\n",
    "course because as we enter rashi and he starts doing the slides he's going to be reading the shlokas\n",
    "each of the shlokas and he's going to be giving interpretations and sometimes the interpretation he will\n",
    "give alternative interpretations something that how people it and what is the uh what is more\n",
    "logical translation and what is the possible translation so guruji is really having this this uh\n",
    "way of teaching that you know he doesn't limit our way of thinking about it he's just giving the you know the\n",
    "standard translation probable meaning of that and then other options as well\n",
    "so if you if you have english translation uh it's fine but i always encourage one\n",
    "which sounds good as well\n",
    "uh naresh is asking about the celestial mother who is this any example you can share i know i i was\n",
    "i was sorry did you want to say\n",
    "the sky father and the the bumi is the the earth mother\n",
    "and that's why when we are seeing the chart why we are seeing the the\n",
    "why we are seeing the lagna on the east because on the eastern horizon the the horizon\n",
    "is the place where the sky father or sky and the earth\n",
    "is connecting you know what is the horizon horizon is junction point between the house the\n",
    "the sky father and the mother earth that's why we are taking from the horizon that\n",
    "we are taking the lagna from the east to to represent our birth to represent the the aditya\n",
    "the rashi that we are born with okay so when we say mother earth\n",
    "it it is the planet earth where we are born and later you you will learn why the the\n",
    "the place is needed why we will come to that but\n",
    "okay but yeah my stuart talking thank you for that we're still talking i i have send you uh somebody's\n",
    "asking about the additional books and additional reading so this is something that you know\n",

    "i my wish is that this time is that we discuss the things that we already\n",
    "studied because for me it's kind of boring no i'm not saying that this\n",
    "is wrong or whatever but i would like to have more time with you not with the material in the sense that\n",

    "so you see bara to check up vara first we need to check\n",
    "up how uh how vara how lord of the vara is placed from the lagna\n",
    "that's why the longevity is uh that's why the health is important\n",
    "because our uh the state of our physical body is seen from the lagna and the\n",
    "relationship between varesha varesha is the one who is lording over the water\n",
    "we will come to that the lords of of the days so lagna and vara are connected\n",
    "this for this connection we need to see how much how much energy is coming to the lagna\n",
    "the tt is connected with the with the fourth house\n",
    "so first thing how to check up the lord of the titty is to see where is it placed from the\n",
    "fourth house is it placed in a good house from the fort or in the bed\n",
    "okay the nakshatra is seen from the seventh\n",
    "house\n",
    "how the the seventh house is the maraca baba is the bhava the is the door through which we will uh\n",
    "we will go from this from this plane that's why the lord of nakshatra needs\n",
    "to be checked from the seventh house in order to to see is the longevity jeopardized or not\n",
    "and in the end karana he is thin from the tenth house because the tenth house\n",
    "is the house of is this house of karma of\n",
    "our deeds so the lord of karana will show us the the position of the current\n",

    "for the chart\n",
    "all prevailing that's why the first thing how we will do the\n",
    "the example about about panchanga to see how to use it\n",
    "okay so what we now uh what we need to to remember first is these five parts\n",
    "are for the five parts of the life the vara is seen from for health t for\n",
    "relationship karana for profession nakshatra for longevity and yoga for\n",
    "union for for everything that we need to connect it will depends\n",
    "upon the the yoga as a part of panchanga\n",
    "okay now we are coming to bara or the day\n",
    "so you've been the reading in the lessons there are seven virus seven uh\n",
    "days in the week and then the repetition is happening the\n",
    "the sanskrit names for them are ravivara somavara mangalavara\n",
    "buddhavara guruvara and shanivara\n",
    "these yeah there was a question on telegram that's why i i put it here for vara we will learn\n",
    "something which is called vara chakra the wheel of the varas the circle where we will use\n",
    "the numbers okay here is the the vara chakra where we will use the the numbers you've\n",
    "been introduced to the guna chakra maybe where we are having the sun is the\n",
    "number one the moon is two the guru is three those three satwik rahas\n",
    "then we are having drachu number four the one who is breaking satwa is\n",
    "so raku is number four then we are having buddha\n",
    "is or mercury is five venus is six this is the rajya's gonna then we are\n",
    "having the ketu who is breaking rajas is number seven\n",
    "we are looking at a different slide it seems the numbers are not matching what you are reading actually\n",
    "yeah no no i am speaking about guna chakra okay okay okay thank you thank you did\n",
    "you get me in the beginning that i said that there is another chakra called guna chakra\n",
    "okay where the the that's why i'm showing the difference between these two chakras\n",
    "okay okay so you you know that most of the time when they are saying\n",
    "that that about the grahas they are they are saying you know ketu is number seven\n",
    "rahu is number four yeah that's true yes guru is number three that is the\n",
    "guna chakra that is the quality of the grahas are shown by that chakra and that chakra\n",
    "is nicely listed in the order of satwa surya chandra guru then node is creating\n",
    "the break then buddha\n",
    "then the again node creating the break ketu seven and then thomas gracas\n",
    "okay and now this vara chakra is for\n",
    "manifestation the water chakra is because the without\n",
    "vara nothing without agni nothing can be manifested\n",
    "that's why the manifestation is coming from the sun of the sun is agni\n",
    "okay so this water chakra we will we will use and you see here are the the numbers are\n",
    "listed as a is the weekdays order surya chandra\n",
    "again to have the the complete chakra\n",
    "yeah and you will see that the the most of the usage that we are that we are using uh in panchanga\n",
    "you will see that there are seven days where only the the the grahas with the\n",
    "body are used from surya to shani\n",
    "and then we are using the titi where ketu has no lordship\n",
    "also the titi is having only eight lords\n",
    "and then the nakshatras uh are having all the the grahas as the\n",
    "lords so\n",
    "so these numbers uh the the the relationships with the graphs we can\n",
    "we can learn from from this vara chakra for example every sixth graha is the\n",
    "enemy to the one\n",
    "you see for for the sun the venus we will act like an enemy it is the chatroo\n",
    "means enemy\n",
    "so for moon shani is the enemy\n",
    "so when we have the sun venus combination in the chart we know that the enmity\n",
    "will arise based on the vara chakra so the manifestation inside of that\n",
    "house can be troublesome can be problematic okay\n",
    "and also the eighth graca in vara chakra we'll create the grahanna we'll create\n",
    "the eclipse on the graha\n",
    "guruji yes here we see for moon one two three\n",
    "five three four five six yes okay for moon who is the enemy for\n",
    "moon six from moon will be the enemy yes six from moon is the sunny\n",
    "okay six from homies are shining yay okay okay just make it sixth yes\n",
    "and six from saturn will be one two three six will be mongol yes\n",
    "six from saturn will be mangal yes yes so for shani chandra is not the enemy\n",
    "but for chandra shani is the enemy yes yes yes so you see the moon is\n",
    "is all about the emotions isn't it so who is the enemy to the emotions what\n",
    "is happening when the moon is conjoined with shani\n",
    "okay somebody can appear called somebody can can create a distance\n",
    "okay\n",
    "yes krishna here so uh we can say that every rashi uh so\n",
    "sorry every graham just before that day is enemy for that which means shukra is\n",
    "enemy for shani shani considered shukra as its enemy can we say that way\n",
    "no the the shani considers you said yeah so every gaha\n",
    "from its sixth is the enemy no the stan the surya\n",
    "is considering venus for an enemy okay\n",
    "okay so if i can't count from shani so shannon chandra mangal no no no no no please\n",
    "count the eight eight uh uh okay okay okay we we need to count uh\n",
    "the uh count the nine grahas for this including draco and ketu\n",
    "okay and this is why how we derived i will come to this uh eighth graha this\n",
    "is how we derived the the eclipse we learned that rahu is eclipsing the sun and ketu is eclipsing\n",
    "the moon okay yes\n",
    "uh if i look at it uh sixth from a guru would be sun so jupiter and uh sun how can they\n",
    "be considered enemies yeah because the guru it's all about\n",
    "akash tatwa the guru is about the connectings isn't it\n",
    "right and then there is the son who is bringing the dharma who is bringing the rules and regulation who can sit with\n",
    "him whose position is where you know\n",
    "so all of those laws are differentiating between people isn't it\n",
    "and we yeah we will we will come to that listen there is a difference between between\n",
    "the the shahru yoga of the guru and surya\n",
    "you know because it's start vaguna\n",
    "so their enmity is more about as a debate not the fight\n",
    "it's much more different than for example shani and uh and the mars\n",
    "channel and the mars shani is somebody who is having uh 100 years old man\n",
    "and there is some youngster who is coming and who is pushing that old man to to run with him understand\n",
    "the the mars is making the pressure on the on the shani\n",
    "and both of them are tamas guna\n",
    "so that will be the the the very big enmity but when it comes to\n",
    "guru and in surya that's a debate that's disagreement more okay thank you\n",
    "okay so yes ravindra namaste\n",
    "sir uh the sixth can also be called as tambana yes yes yes the the one who is blocking\n",
    "okay yeah yeah the the stamban is one of the terms that is used i think\n",
    "okay and the eighth one is the the one who is bringing the eclipse\n",
    "the eighth graph is the one who is enabling grapha to manifest that's the problem\n",
    "okay so when when we uh\n",
    "when we uh see those combinations we will see that the the very manifestation of that graha can be problematic\n",
    "okay so again it's not something which is black and white that's why we will\n",
    "that's why the the the panchang is something that we can that we need to to bring uh\n",
    "just it's the first layer of the things then we will add the things because\n",
    "is something which is quite problematic in the chart it is the eclipse of the sun\n",
    "but if a person goes into the spiritual direction it can become dakshinamurti yoga\n",
    "then the person can can achieve a lot of lot of deep knowledge of spirituality\n",
    "okay i'm just saying not to take this as a black and white thing and we said this is the foundation what\n",
    "we are observing then later we will add bavas rashes grahas okay\n",
    "just one question what is the difference between stumba and graham if both are indeed\n",
    "blockages what is the main difference one one is enmity and one is not allowing\n",
    "the quality manifestation the blocking the the arising of the manifestation so\n",
    "for example how can we use this is is in a very broad term for for example\n",
    "if it's all about conjunction with the grachas okay please this is the the samban only\n",
    "by conjunction all the lorship it's about conjunction and the the thing here is for for\n",
    "example when we are speaking about chatroo and the the we we can have the the if it's the the\n",
    "stambana that is something which is when we got the job then we are experiencing\n",
    "enmity on the job okay if it's the eclipse\n",
    "if it's graham then we cannot find the the job it's a problem to manifest\n",
    "okay okay so in other words graham means you will not get the solution to\n",
    "solve your prarabdha even if it is say adrena karma but i know in other case you will have the\n",
    "solution that's the remedy okay that's the remedy part and that is yeah but it's it's all about the graham\n",
    "we cannot see it and the stamban we are experiencing\n",
    "blockages on the way okay thank you\n",
    "yeah and the about the remedies remedies part is\n",
    "way ahead of us okay i'm sorry just because we are just uh applying and putting the layers okay\n",
    "so here is the the vara example\n",
    "okay and this is the franklin roosevelt chart where we are having\n",
    "the var is varesha he is born on the monday so varesha is\n",
    "the moon okay and in this case moon is in the 10th house\n",
    "you see the 10th and 4th houses are the excess of sustenance of walking\n",
    "so he got the polio how did does it happening you see this moon is conjoined with the\n",
    "mars and this is something which is not so uh\n",
    "not so nice combination because the moon is jala tatwa and the mars is\n",
    "they are creating gandanta by themselves okay the fire and the and the water are not\n",
    "mixing you see and the\n",
    "one of the best position from the for the moon is the fourth house the fourth house is the place where the\n",
    "moon is having digbala\n",
    "okay then what is the you say they cause uh\n",
    "moon and chandra mass in chandra and they come together they cause this thing then people talk about what\n",
    "is chandra mangala yoga that is chandra mangala yoga\n",
    "one of the the names of chandra mangala is also rudra yoga okay\n",
    "so it's having the the tremendous power also but here but basically we need to see\n",
    "who is the the the winning factor you see here the moon is opposite to the fourth house\n",
    "okay it is called shunya digbala so zero it has no strength\n",
    "and again we will learn that that this moon is blocked there is a moon is conjoined\n",
    "malefic and there is one malefic behind that and there is another male effect you see this\n",
    "chain in the chart okay i think this\n",
    "do you see the the pen is it okay so you see this chain\n",
    "there is shiny then there is ketu then there is mars\n",
    "so when we are having three male effects they are three male effects in row they are creating blockages but what we want to\n",
    "to come this is the the starting point what we want to see is here that\n",
    "there is a possibility for some illness in the chart because varesha moon is\n",
    "afflicted by the mars and is having zero digbala\n",
    "it is lacking the strength okay\n",
    "the problem it's not about the the moon it's not the problem because the the\n",
    "vara is agni agni principle so the moon can bring\n",
    "so we cannot say that every all the persons born on the monday have a problem no\n",
    "it's not because of that it is because the moon is conjoined mars\n",
    "so they are creating uh creating the problem okay uh guruji\n",
    "yes uh sir as you said that uh stambana can get activated if the two\n",
    "planets are conjoined as a conjunction but here uh like saturn no here is not here is\n",
    "not stambana okay here is not stambana here is the\n",
    "only something that afflicted varesha can bring the problems that that\n",
    "that is all what we are learning here you know to check up in the beginning to check up what\n",
    "varesha is doing he's placed and the the problem is also the the ultimate source of agni\n",
    "is the surya you see and here varesha is placed\n",
    "in the sixth house from surya in the anonymity shadow house from sun that is also something with what we need\n",
    "to take it uh yeah the\n",
    "the agni isn't uh libya is asking isn't agni good for\n",
    "here the afflictions yeah the afflictions here agni is good for vara of course for varesha but\n",
    "if the varesha then it should be good if it's in shrines so it can support but the moon mars\n",
    "by themselves conjoined is the problem okay you said the saturn\n",
    "ketu and mass 3 malefics are behind the moon but isn't guru blocking saturn in the\n",
    "middle yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's that's for for detailed analysis okay analyze sorry\n",
    "sir sorry one question so i understand that vara\n",
    "prolongs is related to health if yes basically and you're varish being\n",
    "chandra and which is now being with\n",
    "fiery planet mars also not being big bala so it is affecting the health and as you\n",
    "said the four and ten axis is about that movement so the person is suffering from polio\n",
    "because you're also saying that it is followed by ketu uh which is again malefic and plus\n",
    "saturn behind that but i have one question saturn being in eighth house\n",
    "will it not support in terms of health no no it's happening in the eighth house\n",
    "is good for longevity okay but health problems will be there basically yeah yeah\n",
    "he's not guaranteeing good good health um okay it's problems shawnee once\n",
    "there are two two malefics you know that there is uh there is mars and there is sunny money\n",
    "wants mars wants to end it quickly where is that karma to burn left\n",
    "let us do it slowly that's why shani in the eighth house is good for longevity\n",
    "but the quality of that longevity is something that needs to be a certain from from various other\n",
    "positions okay yeah basically what i wanted in this chart because we we are uh it's taking too\n",
    "much of time for this just to check out [Music]\n",
    "see it placement from lagna okay and why did i choose this it can be\n",
    "tricky because the tenth house is a good position from lagna isn't it it's in kendra\n",
    "yeah but again then depends which graphite is if it is the moon then the placement of\n",
    "in the fourth house is beautiful okay\n",
    "if it's in the seventh house it's okay position but if it's in the tent it's zero digbala no strength\n",
    "con conjoined mars that's the problem rudra yoga is there so some problems again appear\n",
    "and on top of that it is in the bad placement from the sun\n",
    "we confirmed for from various just based on panchanga from various parts that these persons\n",
    "can experience a big problems related to health\n",
    "yeah we are saying the placement from sun because ideally sun is\n",
    "there the sun is the source of all the energy if sun\n",
    "decides to uh decline the energy we are done isn't it that's right also\n",
    "the position of varesha from the sun is showing how much support varesha because\n",
    "basically what the varesha is doing he is doing the sun's job\n",
    "[Music]\n",
    "movement of the sun that's right the position from the sun will also play the role\n",
    "okay agree okay thank you yeah varadosha that is from the\n",
    "that is from the uh from the lesson which appears and there is a difference\n",
    "different translations uh one on the website and the one in the pdf yeah varadorsha\n",
    "is basically stating that the the person uh if it's born on the\n",
    "vara of the planet and if the how does it say in a daylight\n",
    "if it's the sun then the if it's the sun guru or venus then the\n",
    "varadosh exists this varadosha is something that appears but needs to be\n",
    "very afflicted in a very bad position you know for a person on sunday born on a\n",
    "daylight to to experience the problems okay\n",
    "the position from from lagna is something that we need to consider more position from\n",
    "lagna and from the surya okay which one dominate\n",
    "from lagna or from surya let's say planet is 12th from lagna but dominate because\n",
    "it is our life okay okay you see the the the position for\n",
    "for example shani in the moon here the moon is is in the sixth house from the sun\n",
    "so the quality of that day is for everybody but how will somebody experience that\n",
    "that will depends upon the lagna of the person okay okay thank you\n",
    "so much the remedies as we are still not on the on the the remedies we are just\n",
    "one more question uh your vanish being conjuncted\n",
    "will dosha be even more aggravated for example here i can see that yes moon and mongol\n",
    "water and fire definitely it's causing a gandant yoga but it depends yes yeah\n",
    "it's really it cannot be given yeah the the varesha conjoined the node it's not\n",
    "so happy situation okay but also it depends where\n",
    "are those those nodes what are they are doing here the the if we but we can go on and on because\n",
    "you see here the mars is in buddha sign it's in ituna and buddha and\n",
    "mars are mangala they are dire enemies\n",
    "so even though the the the mars is having digbala in the 10th\n",
    "house it will not support because he doesn't like the the area where he is\n",
    "okay so one question to complete this so if the\n",
    "is with the sun is it considered positive because\n",
    "the varesha with the sun after the initial problems it will be okay\n",
    "especially if the graha is combust\n",
    "okay can i ask something as well yes uh for example if we reverse the\n",
    "situation uh and if varesha is mars and he is with moon does that mean um is it\n",
    "negative for mars this mars acts um as debilitated when it's positioned with moon\n",
    "for example okay yes yeah the this this combination is otherwise\n",
    "either water completely uh turn off the fire or the fire completely drain the water\n",
    "the problem is exist one graha will will uh one graha will be defeated and the\n",
    "other will will have the dead body next to it understand so this in both ways are\n",
    "problematic the it will be better if the mars were varesha because the mars\n",
    "is having digbala from lagna okay so more strength will be there\n",
    "anyway the this mars gave him the strength because uh despite the polio he was very active\n",
    "he was having the the energy to to follow up the uh social interactions and things\n",
    "like that okay but the mars being there have strengthened his mind\n",
    "because he knew how to keep himself together when the going would get very that's the\n",
    "analysis we just wanted to see places of maresha from lagna and from\n",
    "the sun okay just as the beginning thing which can be which can be done\n",
    "okay so now yes uh so suppose if the\n",
    "area is 12th from the lagna and what if it is exalted how do we see that\n",
    "the belt from the lagna is a problem but if it's exalted what we\n",
    "want to proceed is the the exaltation is the giving the comfort\n",
    "level okay okay\n",
    "so it doesn't it will uh for example we are sick but our bed is very\n",
    "comfortable you know we are sick but we can afford the that is the exaltation\n",
    "okay and uh that is the the status of the graph is an exaltation\n",
    "but the placement in the 12th house can bring the problems are they serious or not that depends on\n",
    "the conjunctions that depends on on the aspects of the other grahas you\n",
    "know if if the planet is saturn and it is in\n",
    "the 12th house how would that be and we say that uh\n",
    "the malefics like saturn and mangala and in this particular case we were discussing with mangal and chandra\n",
    "what if a mangal is aspecting uh saturn\n",
    "in the 12th house which is the vaaresha from 12th from the lagna\n",
    "so the the it's rishi kalani with the shani in the 12th house yes born on saturday yes\n",
    "and yeah here the the aspect of uh an aspect of manga but does that where\n",
    "is mangal\n",
    "yeah this can bring the problems related to the health but due to exaltation the the cure can\n",
    "be found especially because the and that's why\n",
    "i'm saying that there is more to it you know then you can check that that\n",
    "that shani is the the lord of the fourth house placed in the in the 12th okay the fourth house is the\n",
    "cure so the person will find the cure but the level of energy can with the\n",
    "with the 12th house it can fall you know half of the day is\n",
    "having a lot of energy then half of the day is drained\n",
    "rashid is also a permanent okay\n",
    "depends and we will learn that with the we have we are having the special lessons about graha drishti and rashid\n",
    "okay but so and we are delaying this uh\n",
    "this video as we come to the titty okay so the titi the titi you know\n",
    "you see lordship of the titties are again based on the vara chakra\n",
    "the same order of grahas are like in the weekdays you see surya chandra mangala buddha\n",
    "guru shukra shani and rahul\n",
    "doesn't have a rulership inside of of the titi chakra\n",
    "ketu is has no interesting uh has no interest in\n",
    "desires okay so and you see the the names of the titties\n",

    "why this how the sequence happened\n",
    "yeah it's every fourth when you start with the sun it's every fourth graha based on the\n",
    "speed of the grahas okay that is how how the vara chakra is composed\n",

    "of the problem will depend on the further uh estimation of the chart\n",
    "but what we know what we learn here is that the foundation the seed the the\n",
    "the first layer is having some problems that's our job in this level okay at the present level\n",
    "what we are just assuming that if a person is born on a kadashi then there can be some problems\n",

    "it's placed in the tenth house in enemies russia the venus is in aries and it's having\n",
    "again zero digbala okay but it's in kendra so there will be\n",
    "relationships the kendra are the places where we are\n",
    "interacting with the people so in the\n",
    "uh yes in this case the lagna is in the natural\n",
    "fourth house want the lagna therefore benefit because shukra typically gets digbala in the\n",
    "fourth house won't it get the benefit because it's in the natural fourth house\n",

    "to shukra because not so much okay no no\n",
    "because the the the especially here we okay we will learn more because you will\n",
    "learn that that actually venus doesn't like the fourth house from itself okay okay\n",
    "so the the problem here is that the relationships were there\n",
    "but the position of the venus is pretty problematic\n",
    "zero digbala and having the the and having the the enemy sign inside of\n",
    "it okay\n",
    "relationship between shukra and chandra is a 410 that is also not is it is that all that\n",

    "because the ability to fall in love is coming from the from the fifth house okay okay okay\n",
    "thank you so and you and then that we are getting into those gray areas what is happening\n",
    "if the titty lord is in the fourth house nicely placed that means it's in the\n",
    "twelfth house from the fifth so the person is having good relationship with everybody around but\n",
    "cannot fall in love everybody is friends okay\n",
    "or if the the titty lord is in the fifth house i'm constantly falling in love so i cannot have any other relationship\n",

    "uh is the southeast direction and the the who is getting digbala who\n",
    "is lording over in big chakra over this direction is the venus that's why the\n",
    "venus is giving the ability to see the details\n",
    "okay that's why the venus ruling the art because the art it's all about\n",
    "connecting details connecting colors connecting tunes connect you see all\n",
    "about it is how does venus having that because of the this lordship of the agni corner\n",

    "as the chakra the surya the color chakra is showing the\n",
    "blockages of the grahas\n",
    "okay so you see the the agni corner is ruled by venus in this chakra\n",
    "who is creating who is blocking the agony who is blocking the venus is the mars\n",
    "you see the mars is the one who is creating the problem in the sight\n",

    "notice shukra has southeast direction and it has virgo sign however shukra we have virgo sign there\n",
    "shukrag is debilitated in virgo i am little confused because even if i look at you know surya and shani they have\n",
    "exactly surya gets exerted in the east and shani gets exalted in the west it's beautifully\n",
    "placed but rest of the grahas it's showing the other way around so i'm a little confused here yeah and the guru is very badly placed\n",
    "in the third house isn't it exactly so i am a little confused here\n",
    "yeah don't be confused we will learn that the exaltation and\n",
    "debilitation and we will learn the the marana karakastana that is why the the how much of the\n",
    "the the knowledge we can uh how much of the of the the art that the exalted\n",
    "venus can bring when it's in the heaven we cannot reach it\n",
    "and how much is going when it's starting from the scratch okay the this that what you ask is is\n",
    "totally valid question and it's philosophical so we will come to do it when we start speaking about the\n",
    "exaltation and debilitation okay\n",
    "when it comes to to the the agni is the one who is giving the form okay\n",
    "and the that's why the venus is the one who is have ability to give\n",
    "the form even in the corporate sector the venus is the one who is managing who is creating and making the the you\n",
    "know the structure so what is the problem is we are seeing color chakra\n",
    "it is the mangala is the problem yes yes inside venus itself the total venus\n",
    "is uh is water so how does it support fire\n",
    "no this is this is completely the the quality of this uh of these uh\n",
    "agni is here the devata not\n",
    "ten lords of the directions okay so it will act and here the the agni\n",
    "is the the agni is the guru brahmana okay\n",
    "so and it has the the the agni has the ability to bring the the all the prayers\n",
    "to all the prayers to the gods you know that the the agni is the one\n",
    "who is taking those prayers so it is much more than than just the\n",
    "thoughtful level of agni okay and also the the venus\n",
    "venus is somebody who is brahmana the only two grahas are brahmanas\n",
    "so the knowledge that venus is having is also high don't forget that okay\n",
    "so let us just finish tala chakra so the the mars is the one who is uh\n",
    "blocking the agni guru is somebody who is uh there is the\n",
    "that saying that the yama is not coming where guru is sitting and when we start learning that the\n",
    "longevity you will see that the guru's aspect can prevent that that is why the guru\n",
    "is having uh ability to to block this yama corner\n",
    "yama direction okay so but who is also group can can block\n",
    "look at the big chakra it's manga so the guru can block manga\n",
    "how is it seen how can you see the blockage in the chakra what\n",
    "how do we how do we see that blockage in the dick chakra when you say guru is blocking mangala\n",
    "how is it visually manifesting you see that the guru is lording in kala chakra with the south\n",
    "direction okay okay so the color chakra it's all about the\n",
    "blockages inside of time so what guru wants he wants to block\n",
    "you he wants to block the debt guru is\n",
    "you know the the makara is the graveyard the guru is getting debilitated\n",
    "inside of the the makhara he doesn't like that the third house is the house of dying\n",
    "guru is having maranacara there you know because why the guru is\n",
    "jiva is the soul so everything which is\n",
    "opposed to the soul equals that is something that guru will be against\n",
    "and it will have the ability to prevent okay buddha is the one who can block rahu\n",
    "in the nurity corner buddha is so basically what is buddha it's all about\n",
    "administrative organization putting in folders isn't it all the administrative work belongs to buddha\n",
    "so you see the the moment when you put the structure or something on something\n",
    "the nearly the the disorder disappears okay as soon as we structurize something the\n",
    "the chaos is vanishing okay\n",
    "shukra is the one yes uh guruji just to idea what i have understood is that uh the planets\n",
    "which were placed in directions of the chakra yes uh basically we are applying the sixth\n",
    "from that planet is taking taken place by the planet in kala chakra\n",
    "for example if i account six from uh rahu where we discuss that\n",
    "it will be blocked by guru so basically the group position is taken by rahu\n",
    "and likewise for no no no please please there is there is vada today we learned\n",
    "four chakras that's why it's a in those four chakras there is a vara chakra\n",
    "there is a titty chakra there is a dick chakra and there is color chakra okay please for a while keep them\n",
    "separately okay okay\n",
    "because all of these there are so many blockages that we will come we still didn't start with it with the\n",
    "yogas we didn't okay so just these are the concepts that you that\n",
    "there is something called big chakra and there is something called color chakra okay one is where the graph is experiencing\n",
    "full potential and the other is where graha is getting blocked okay okay so what is\n",
    "happening the graha the buddha has the ability to block nurity kona\n",
    "okay sukra is have the ability to block varunakona\n",
    "to prevent shani so the the venus has the ability\n",
    "to block the the chinese for example coldness\n",
    "distancing okay\n",
    "no don't shankar don't use the chart right now we are just seeing the the uh okay yeah from various\n",
    "positions depending on which type of uh which type of longevity you are using\n",
    "the the guru will act sometimes the guru drishti will help sometimes the guru's position will help but it depends on so\n",
    "many other factors okay we're in the seventh house not so much guru is having zero digbal in the\n",
    "seventh house we will learn take it easy so the the in the color chakra the the\n",
    "shiny is yes the shiny is getting a good question yes\n",
    "the reason being uh when i look at the west direction shukra is something with that is the graha that\n",
    "is blocking however are very good friends so i am\n",
    "yeah so how is it blocking so that is something how is this again the the it's all about what i said\n",
    "why the shawnee rules the varuna kona is the varun is somebody who will give\n",
    "to some only to the people who deserve okay and again we need to to check up\n",
    "which are the the the which are the grahas which are\n",
    "uh having these connections in order to see what i said the venus\n",
    "can there is somebody who is dissatisfied old man\n",
    "somewhere the venus the young lady with the fond of jokes and things like that\n",
    "can melt that frozen heart isn't it right that is the relationship\n",
    "the relationship for example guru maharaj is the problem because the place\n",
    "where the guru is feeling exalted the mars is feeling debilitated the place where the\n",
    "mars is exactly the guru is debilitated so yamakona is the problem\n",
    "it's much more uh the bigger battle is there okay\n",
    "these pairs later and especially when we start learning\n",
    "when we start learning about the very nature of the grahas their character there's responsibilities there you will\n",
    "more and more uh understand the color chakra deeply the color chakra is something which has\n",
    "so much into it this what i'm giving here is the very core base you know the the the basic\n",
    "terminology of karla chakra okay just to to to realize that there is\n",
    "something which is blocking and not so the kubera\n",
    "is the who can block the kubera is the moon the emotions can block the\n",
    "this is the the dilemma will i have life or will i have job in the 21st century okay\n",
    "because if you go into the the profession that our complete society social circle everything which moons represents\n",
    "start being blocked but if we that's why the winners can\n",
    "can block the the kubera and uh rahu of course is blocking the\n",
    "ishana the knowledge direction okay\n",
    "so and the rahu can block the uh rahu can blocked guru\n",
    "okay so let's see\n",
    "okay now this is uh i think that uh for for today\n",
    "we will do what you call it a day because it's a hour and\n",
    "40. yeah so the the thing what i can\n",
    "just say is go through the slides learn that now this aramba is there to\n",
    "introduce philosophy to introduce few concepts\n",
    "which will be revisit again there will be revisit because of we're just you know starting with the\n",
    "rushes and starting with the grahas and then when you return to these much the things will be clearer okay\n",
    "is there any more questions that you would like to ask could i please ask about the last slide\n",
    "that we were um discussing for the blockages can we apply this in the nato chart when we\n",
    "look for example if mercury and moon are together we can say that moon is blocking mercury and there is an issue\n",
    "with acquiring wealth or profession no no no no no\n",
    "for example that the mercury has to have something which is\n",
    "called digbala who gained their to gain the strength to pull the the\n",
    "person in the direction of you know for example let us just\n",
    "need this case the the buddha is ruling over kubera's honor in all the cases\n",
    "but when buddha is on lagna it has directional strength\n",
    "guru and buddha on lagna moon and venus in the fourth house uh shani and rahu in the seventh house\n",
    "surya ketu and mars in the tenth house okay so when we have the buddha on lagna\n",
    "then it has the power to pull the persons towards kubera's\n",
    "direction then the person will start thinking that profession earning you know all of those\n",
    "things which kubera represents should be followed okay and then if\n",
    "if for example we are getting the moon conjoined there then then the\n",
    "person will have that struggle inside yes someone will somehow\n",
    "blossom no please this color chakra is let us\n",
    "see for but this is something which really takes uh more to to learn these grahas are\n",
    "sitting on the doors okay so they can\n",
    "moon can open kubera corner or lockdown\n",
    "understand yes so it cannot always guru can save and it\n",
    "may not save and yeah but here what we just wanted to to\n",
    "uh to learn about dig and color chakra is that these uh pairs for example you see the\n",
    "only the the the who is the blockage for surya eco is the blockage for eco that's\n",
    "something which has no doubt you know self uh\n",
    "self development without uh you know sacrifice sacrificing self it's not happening okay\n",
    "all the rest are creating the pairs mangala venus guru mangala buddha\n",
    "shukra so those pairs we really again when you said the chandra buddha\n",
    "those are again that's a debate it's not the war\n",
    "guru maharaja yoga is the the the combination of the priest and the warrior you know what\n",
    "the priest the what the chances has preached and things like that this is just to to uh\n",
    "okay this is just something to to become familiar with the terminology\n",
    "that we will these color chakra and big chakra even on the 40s of parashat in the third\n",
    "throughout the years will be used and the the layers will be added okay right now just a ramban just the\n",
    "beginning just the introduction okay so guruji uh i have a question am i\n",
    "audible yes uh yes hi this is abhi manyo yeah uh so far uh so uh from uh um uh\n",
    "from something to like you know just start with um uh there's the vara and titi uh aspect\n",
    "that you taught us uh today uh i'm more focused on that um so should i start analyzing this uh from\n",
    "uh not just my chart or like whichever other charts i have should i start looking at these things\n",
    "yeah the good thing is the the good thing is take the example that you know what they\n",
    "go through and start to apply it how does it fit with the with the for example if you're seeing\n",
    "relationships start seeing how does it fit okay yeah i saw it for myself\n",
    "now me yeah\n",
    "we will come to to all the parts of panchang just the right okay\n",
    "and this to be understand weba is asking is to be an understand as native with mars in the tenth house should\n",
    "join a professional like army man has direction yeah\n",
    "we will again the the mars in the 10th house that means yes mercy is having the\n",
    "digbala but the 10th house from lagna is the way how we are doing\n",
    "things it's not the profession for the profession we will see so many\n",
    "points we will see uh we will see the second house in\n",
    "navamsha we will see the tenth house from the moon we will see a matia so many things we cannot just\n",
    "the the the mars digbala is giving but the mars doesn't need to\n",
    "bring the army also mars can bring the very good ganetta the mathematical logic\n",
    "okay so so many things and we we cannot uh we cannot based on\n",
    "the the one position we cannot advise a person's profession for example\n",
    "or something like that okay so many other factors will be there one last question\n",
    "yes uh it was about uh worshipping the tt yotiti um and your\n",
    "and the devata and i was actually a bit confused because we were giving two um two\n",
    "dividers here um and it said it's to be worshipped the teacher and the vata so\n",
    "no but what i what i ask what i uh ask from you uh what i said earlier\n",
    "i didn't know didn't i don't know did you catch that that we are using\n",
    "the devotees to understand the titties okay so\n",
    "all those cities are the the the devata is the some somebody who is bringing the knowledge\n",
    "to us okay and then there are so many sampradayas there are shaiva vaishnavas\n",
    "there are so many sampradays which are giving the difference deities to be worshipped on different\n",
    "dates on the different cities okay so but from the jiotis point of\n",
    "view we want to learn the essence the essence is learning about uh learning about\n",
    "the the titi devatas for example you see this uh for panchami for panchami\n",
    "it is aki it is\n",
    "you see in the in the in the table yes yes uh but looking at the pdfs that\n",
    "we had from the from the website where there's for example for 3k it's given gauri\n",
    "and you know carrier of the yes yes and that is what i'm\n",
    "saying there will be so many devatas in different traditions there will be\n",
    "different for for different purposes there will be different uh deities okay so the second one is the\n",
    "one that removes the obstacles and evils to be worshipped or am i the no\n",
    "no the the obstacles will depend the the remedies are the the final outcome you know the\n",
    "worship we really need to understand what is going on what we need to to remedy you know otherwise it's a\n",
    "guesswork if we are just blindly that's why what i just wanted to show you the example\n",
    "there is panchamytiti with the sarpa is the deity ahi\n",
    "okay the sarpa can mean the snake\n",
    "but the sarpa can mean also the rope okay so then\n",
    "when we know that there is something called rishi panchami\n",
    "the the titi the fifth tt where the rishis are worship we will more connect the serpa\n",
    "with the rope with the lineage with the rishis that we are belonging to\n",
    "okay so what the panchami and then we uh then we know who is the one who is\n",
    "bringing the the knowledge of the rishis that is saraswati who is willing to\n",
    "share with us that's why we will own panchami we will worship saraswati okay through the learning of the\n",
    "devotees and that is a huge job that will take up it's not something\n",
    "and uh when it comes to to the remedies when it comes to the worship\n",
    "my advice right now is stick to the sadhana which being advised at the beginning\n",
    "and write down because you you will come to in one moment you will come the the\n",
    "every lesson that you learn there is there will be some remedy that can be done you know it's impossible\n",
    "that's why the the the we we are having this uh\n",
    "scholar applause approach let us learn and then when the when the time comes\n",
    "the remedy will appear don't worry okay yes thank you i will just remember the\n",
    "difference between these two debit types that were given in in our little there is so so many devata types i'm\n",
    "telling you that there will be and we will add for for so for the\n",
    "titties and okay and oh everything will have the its\n",
    "purpose okay okay people it's almost two hours one last doubt i have\n",
    "can i okay yes i'm just confused about moon as the graha and chandra as the\n",
    "devata should we should we consider it i mean i understand which it's the light aspect\n",
    "you say but yes as the devata as the chandra should we look then both are similar or different like moon\n",
    "is also called chandra right indeed the moon is chandra okay the surya so but there are the two\n",
    "different uh we can i say like two different jobs that they are having you know there is a there is a as\n",
    "a as the physical uh as a physical being the sun is bringing the light and the heat\n",
    "you know as a star on the sky but sturya is a devata is bringing the upholdment\n",
    "of dharma it's bringing the so many things everything comes from the sun\n",
    "okay so also the soma soma is the one who is born from the churning of the\n",
    "ocean to be placed on the head of shiva okay okay so the summer it's chandra\n",
    "and then the soma starts seeing his position as somebody who is quite privileged because he is somebody\n",
    "who calmed down the shiva after drinking the the after drinking the\n",
    "poison and then moon start thinking okay maybe i can do whatever i can so maybe to kidnap the\n",
    "wife of brihaspati so you see and then end up with the curse of shiva okay i got it so and that curse is\n",
    "also physically manifesting from our point of view the moon is having their faces\n",
    "okay so okay anything else\n",
    "yeah you will have the video now but the slides what you presented or we should we can copy and paste we\n",

    "um yeah you can all see slideshow\r\n",
    "that's good okay so um today we have an easy topic\r\n",
    "you know and i think it was uh i believe this lesson was also needed following this longer period of um\r\n",
    "you know that for a longer period that we spent on ramba creation and philosophy i trust that you needed grounding so but\r\n",
    "before we start on today's topic i wanted to to talk about just a few things you know i wish to\r\n",
    "address and the questions that you had and shared with us over telegram or privately since our last webinar\r\n",
    "so one of those things is um we already said a few times but it's\r\n",
    "always good to get in mind that you'll be coming back to all these topics again and again\r\n",
    "a really good description of the process of learning jotash is that it's kind of like going in a spiral way you know we keep\r\n",
    "on going uh circling you know up and down depending on which level we are picking up so we will\r\n",
    "cover the same topic over and over just from a different angle or from a different level or\r\n",
    "in a with a different concept in mind so if you have any fear uh in a sense that\r\n",
    "you know now we are doing rushes and i don't i still don't feel like we learn all about the rushes you should\r\n",
    "not have that because right now we kind of learn uh learn this one tool\r\n",
    "you know and then you know as we go and as we progress in a different context we are going to\r\n",
    "learn a new science to the russians so it's kind of like um if you may it's\r\n",
    "kind of like making this beautiful jottish cake and uh and and for that cake to make\r\n",
    "you know for for that cake to be made we need the rashes and we need a graha and we need bava and oh and etc\r\n",
    "all those ingredients so you need to know about them specifically before we take them you know on a ride\r\n",
    "so i hope you like this housewife metaphor you know i was just thinking guru ji calls them jotish tools\r\n",
    "so right now we are we are learning about russia's but we will learn about the russia again and again again\r\n",
    "so we learned a lot right now in this lesson but there will be more to that we're gonna add\r\n",
    "uh another uh a way of looking at this is also uh uh that that you know vice learning\r\n",
    "uh uh jotish it's it's like we need two tools one is you know a telescope and that is to get you know the broad\r\n",
    "picture and that was the whole aramba and srishti portion and then we need a microscope and today\r\n",
    "what we are doing is kind of going with a microscope like what rashi really is what are all those\r\n",
    "layers that come that have to do with arashi\r\n",
    "so that was one thing you know i just wouldn't want you to have an anxiety as to like you know now we are done and\r\n",
    "there is no way back now we are keep we will keep on using them all the time\r\n",
    "um a second question was about uh kind of kind of about expectations\r\n",
    "for this course uh you should know that learning jotis is kind of uh it's like performing brahmayagya\r\n",
    "where whilst we are learning the subject you know at the same time devas are\r\n",
    "working or doing work on us so just because we are going slowly\r\n",
    "and going you know taking these fundamentals to the smallest details\r\n",
    "at the same time you know devas are changing your mind you know jyotish is like learning a new language and whilst you're learning new\r\n",
    "language you're developing new synapses so also all those things like you know i'm not sure if my concepts are right or\r\n",
    "you know you know if my belief is right and all this that all that is going to come along the\r\n",
    "way and your life is going to improve along the way just by focusing on a study\r\n",
    "so for example um one of the things that you you have approached me about was\r\n",
    "uh you had fears you know you were facing some fears because suddenly you opened your chart and you\r\n",
    "were wondering what if i have this panchanga dosha and that is very very natural for the\r\n",
    "beginning stages you know i will tell you a very nice um a story you know that guruji\r\n",
    "told us about this you know in a in a different context but it's applicable here as well and that is like\r\n",
    "you know when you focus on something it's kind of like you know flashing the light on a small small the smallest of the\r\n",
    "details so for example if you're looking at the durga you know and you are for you're so\r\n",
    "you get so afraid because all you see is do you know the the the the fierce you know nails of the\r\n",
    "lion the durga is sitting on of course you will be afraid but what you should you know what we should know\r\n",
    "is that that's because that's the only thing that right now we are seeing we are not seeing the rest of the picture\r\n",
    "so just you know give yourself some grace trust the process and trust the\r\n",
    "mantra that we are doing that they are satwik yeah can you hear me still\r\n",
    "okay i got some echo trust the satwik and trust that the whole picture\r\n",
    "you know there is no there is waiting for you you see uh for example i never got a reading from\r\n",
    "goriji you know but i did or i did get all the knowledge that uh get me to make the right\r\n",
    "decisions for my life and also all the right sadhana to get where i want to be you know to have a\r\n",
    "good quality of life so take your time and give yourself some grace\r\n",
    "and we are going to be fine also when when you talk about the fears there is something there about the gunas\r\n",
    "of the mind and that is uh that we say that the thomas guna is the one who is looking\r\n",
    "down so and the rajas guna is that when when one looks you know front what is just in\r\n",
    "front of them was the south faguna is looking up now we use this example and this narrative\r\n",
    "in many different ways one is for example uh it talks about the mindset and that is that one should always look\r\n",
    "for the highest you know always strive for the highest always uh aim for the highest\r\n",
    "doesn't matter where we are right now but you know keep your uh your side up that's one thing another\r\n",
    "thing is also in in the spiritual sadhana when we are doing something called or when we are worshiping the idol you\r\n",
    "know by by observing the looking at the idol we always go from the feet upwards\r\n",
    "and that is the movement of the guna so don't worry you know the whole picture\r\n",
    "of durga is much nicer than what you're looking at if you're just looking at you know lions feet\r\n",
    "and uh and then the third question was uh about uh yeah i got a question\r\n",
    "about if it is all right to have an idol of another idol sorry a picture of sanjay\r\n",
    "on the altar or worship him in any way now don't get surprised that's something that i heard\r\n",
    "quite a bit so no we don't do that we on on our ideal idol\r\n",
    "on our altar sorry we put only the the pictures or the idols that are\r\n",
    "worshipable so guruji was he's always very clear about what is his role or what is our\r\n",
    "role and that is you know he is shikshakura he belongs to the fifth house he is teaching us the subject and the\r\n",
    "subject that he is teaching us is jotis it's uh is it it is as if you know\r\n",
    "a teacher was teaching the subject called mathematics or any other subject so that that is his role on the other\r\n",
    "hand in the ninth house we can see a diksa guru and that's the teacher or a guru that takes your soul on a\r\n",
    "certain path you know it takes responsibility for your soul you know we say even that he takes the\r\n",
    "one-sixth of your sins so that is your diksa guru that is his role and his domain and that's in the\r\n",
    "ninth house so please don't put you know sanjay's name in a mantra and worship him\r\n",
    "or his picture on the altar yeah i hope you appreciate that i know\r\n",
    "it might sound you know uh to some it might sound strange but you know i\r\n",
    "i i believe that you know what is what is most personal is also most\r\n",
    "universal you might have that question so i hope it helps\r\n",
    "so that's it for now you know uh for about housekeeping you know let's\r\n",
    "get started on our slide so today we are talking about the rashi\r\n",
    "and rashes verupa and they were the way i wanted to go about this is\r\n",
    "that you know this lesson is seemingly very easy it is very concrete and but you had\r\n",
    "several questions which i wanted to clear up during our time together so let's get\r\n",
    "started i just wanted to be sure that you can\r\n",
    "still hear me just check\r\n",
    "okay looks fine\r\n",
    "so uh arashi uh russian names you know sanjay uh um so there are two things\r\n",
    "first there are popularly known names for all twelve rushes and i believe all of us know about them\r\n",
    "but parashar is specific about it you know the names of the 12 rashes that parashar\r\n",
    "is using are those names that are you know praiseworthy that are you know that we can put in a mantra\r\n",
    "that we can worship so there are several names that are a bit different for\r\n",
    "from what is popularly known so you cannot see slides in the zoom okay\r\n",
    "just a second\r\n",
    "guys can you see my slide\r\n",
    "can you see my slides now\r\n",
    "okay cool okay i didn't know that\r\n",
    "can you hear me all this time\r\n",
    "yes okay perfect then okay i got scared there for a second\r\n",
    "okay technology i'm just gonna open chat on the side so\r\n",
    "i know what's up okay perfect so yeah so the\r\n",
    "names that are different from what we for what we know for me what we popularly know or use are\r\n",
    "so let's just read them you know once and then we can you know shortly talk about the few that kind of\r\n",
    "you know was that were mentioned in the telegram group submission risha and guru is a bit specific it is\r\n",
    "brishaba but brisha in uh is what parashara is mentioning\r\n",
    "kumari\r\n",
    "now the only difference that that that you will see is that it's with kanya or komari\r\n",
    "where uh parashara is a bit more specific that it's kumari it's the young girl it's the virgin girl it's the\r\n",
    "the it's the what is praiseworthy is really her purity you know if you may then\r\n",
    "with uh rishika we use ali and kurichi talks about how you know you\r\n",
    "wouldn't really you know approach you know deva in a sense by telling by telling you know you are the one you\r\n",
    "know you're the scorpion or scorpion or you know dangerous so he uses the name\r\n",
    "ali and uh you mentioned you know you or you already found that you know ali\r\n",
    "means a beasting or it even means a bridge which is the reference or it can be used\r\n",
    "as a reference to gandanta that finds its place in in scorpio but there\r\n",
    "is one meaning of the name that you didn't mention and that i have clearly in my notes when we were studying this it's\r\n",
    "ali also means exalted and it is a reference to a body part\r\n",
    "uh that holds the semen you know and it is said that the semen of the human body is the finest\r\n",
    "product of the body so it uh those who know a bit more about ayurveda\r\n",
    "when we when we eat you know the process of digesting that food you know is happening in several stages\r\n",
    "and you know and i don't know them by any means but they're like you know some of it feeds our blood and some of\r\n",
    "it feeds our you know our muscles and some of it you know different different different uh tissues in our body\r\n",
    "but the last one that is being produced from from the body is the semen or the video\r\n",
    "and that is why they say this is you know the uh and by and in the as a body part that\r\n",
    "is where the semen is being stored in the sign known as ali or richika\r\n",
    "so that was the reference there um and you know now that we're on that\r\n",
    "topic you know that that's why they say it you know in our way that it's very important that once you uh once you intake the food\r\n",
    "you do not eat more or you do not eat again until that what you have eaten has been\r\n",
    "processed fully otherwise you are cutting the process at some point and then you know that last part me is\r\n",
    "suffering or is not being produced okay that was a small note on ali anakra\r\n",
    "makkara you know um is another name and uh\r\n",
    "nakra in uh interestingly is uh um\r\n",
    "uh it they say it nakra means a reversal of the hell you know nakara you know in uh the the\r\n",
    "hells which are uh known as uh you know there there was a reversal\r\n",
    "there and then the the war that was given was nakra instead which means that it can reverse the hell\r\n",
    "but what it really means is that this sign belongs to the tenth house which corresponds with\r\n",
    "our karmas with our work with what we are doing and it is dependent on and depending on\r\n",
    "our karma to know where is it that we are going following you know after this this\r\n",
    "uh early experience you know are we going towards svarga which is also symbolically representing\r\n",
    "there or are we going to toward the narakas or the lower lower portions\r\n",
    "so so uh makara or nakra which corresponds to the tenth house\r\n",
    "shows that quality you know and that is kind of your or our free\r\n",
    "will you know depending on our karmas we get to decide where we are going\r\n",
    "you know further and the last two names are very much known kumba and mina\r\n",
    "now uh about the rashi symbol in the flow this is something that was mentioned in indicated on our website but it was not\r\n",
    "fully you know that lesson was not thought in in in a detail so\r\n",
    "here's the thing you know the it is said that out of um and so how do i say this\r\n",
    "let's start with this all of the names all of the russian names are basically indicating the symbol of\r\n",
    "those rashes as well and now when uh the symbol of that rashi\r\n",
    "is very clear meaning that there is a one picture in front of us you know something that guruji refers to\r\n",
    "as being advaita so it's one focused image then that sign is said to be\r\n",
    "clear you know and it doesn't carry any but for all of those rashes that have\r\n",
    "like a dual picture of a confusion of the picture of several two or more elements\r\n",
    "including including in them those are those that we call the those are the rushes that carry a brahma\r\n",
    "dosha or creation dosha or creation flow so there are so many things we can get\r\n",
    "out of this concept but let's start from the beginning so what are those rashes whose symbol is clear\r\n",
    "and you will see that sanjit this is the picture taken from one of the guruji's lessons\r\n",
    "is that you know for example mesha is a clear image it's only a gold or a ram there is\r\n",
    "nothing extra there you know and if somebody tells you a ram you have a picture of a ram\r\n",
    "so then the second one is rishabha that's also clear there is nothing extra place there then we have mituna now\r\n",
    "that's the first one that has a flow and uh the reason why it has a flow is what we\r\n",
    "said you know there are there are two people in fact there are four elements to this rashi they're not only\r\n",
    "it's not only that there's a boy and a girl there is also a boy holding a club and a\r\n",
    "girl holding a musical instrument so there are four if and then on top of that some use some\r\n",
    "mention different musical and instruments and some mentioned\r\n",
    "mentioned different weapons that the boy is holding so the clear so the picture is distorted and that's\r\n",
    "why we say that this rashi carries a dosha okay then fourth rashi is cancer\r\n",
    "and that's a crab so no dosha simha same same thing then kanya with kanye\r\n",
    "again we have a symbol that uh has several different elements\r\n",
    "in it so there is a young girl who who is holding a a lamp lightening the the space in\r\n",
    "front of her in one hand and and and grains in another hand whilst she is\r\n",
    "on a boat so there are so many different elements to this that you know we say that this\r\n",
    "rashi carries a creation dosha as well then tula tula is a man with a scale\r\n",
    "so has dosha as well brishika is a clear scorpion or a clear image\r\n",
    "then danush is again a combined image of an animal\r\n",
    "or the lower part is that of a horse and upper part is that of a man holding a\r\n",
    "bow then the makkara now makara is the one\r\n",
    "where guruji also mentioned other things this this is this is very unclear image\r\n",
    "because there are several you know interpretation of this sign so they say some say that the upper part\r\n",
    "is that of a deer or an antelope and then the the lower part\r\n",
    "is of some kind of unnamed you know watery animal so some say it's a purpose\r\n",
    "or it's the the um the tail of the crocodile or it's a tale of some type of fish we\r\n",
    "don't know about so this is where the picture is really distorted so we say that makara as well\r\n",
    "has a a brahma dosha or creation dosha\r\n",
    "then we have kumba and kumbha is a man holding a pot and a pot in and in the pot he's\r\n",
    "carrying a water uh i've heard guruji once mentioned it's also\r\n",
    "a man holding a pot carrying a water from the river to the mountains\r\n",
    "you know and he used that you know it's an interesting depiction because how do\r\n",
    "you really put that in a picture so uh but he talks about this uh going from a river\r\n",
    "to the mountaintop anyway we'll come back to that again so that so cumber also has a dosha and\r\n",
    "then meena now now could you explain it's it's not only that\r\n",
    "that there are two fishes it's a very different image altogether it's not only two fishes\r\n",
    "it's uh one image of two fishes being entangled with each other you know head\r\n",
    "and tails are being you know pressed together or you know kind of like biting\r\n",
    "biting you know height is biting the tail if you may so we say that meena rasheed has dosha\r\n",
    "as well so now what do we have so the easy memory aid to\r\n",
    "learn which rashes carry a dosha is based on a symbol so those rashes\r\n",
    "that are not one image clear one image or one element are those who carry a dosha and now\r\n",
    "what does dosha really mean you know what what do we in there are two things first is that you know we say it's\r\n",
    "that those rashes which have a dual image or advice or have a several elements in\r\n",
    "them they carry a devadosha and that devadosha is indicated by a planet\r\n",
    "so uh let's start from the beginning and the the way guruji taught\r\n",
    "this lesson you know it was that he would always start with the mina so we'll start with the mina as well\r\n",
    "so mina is a we said you know two fishes and it uh we say uh that the\r\n",
    "dosha the planet keringa dosha is the sun and the adidas of the sun is agni\r\n",
    "so we say that the meena has or carries the curse of agni\r\n",
    "and you will find and it's a good exercise and homework for you to find a puranic story about it but the\r\n",
    "fish fish fishes sorry were cursed by the agni to forever stay underneath the water and\r\n",
    "to never see the sunlight so what happened with fishes was that you know the only way a fish could see a\r\n",
    "sunlight is to jump out of the water and you know hold the bread because they can't\r\n",
    "breathe they can't leave a live out of the water so that's why i made this you know reference to\r\n",
    "pranayama they say it's a really good thing for all meena lagna's mean ascendants\r\n",
    "to do pranayama to clear this dosha\r\n",
    "following that so that you will notice a pattern here there will be a planet which shows the\r\n",
    "dosha there will be a planet which shows the dosha but the adidas of that planet\r\n",
    "will show the uh the uh deva that is being angered or deva that is being upset and\r\n",
    "hence these rashes have that dosha so then uh i will summarize at the end but let's go\r\n",
    "to the next next uh sign so kumbha it is said that\r\n",
    "the planet showing the dosha of the kumba is chandra and the adidas jala so we say that the\r\n",
    "kumba carrie has a jala dosha and i mentioned here that the water is burdened and that is\r\n",
    "because this kumba has this a very peculiar thing in them and that is that you know they have this spot and\r\n",
    "they they have a certain you know we say that 11th house and kumbaya is hopes and desires\r\n",
    "you know so they have the pot and they want to carry the water to the you know from point a to the point b\r\n",
    "but that water is burdened to them and the longer it takes them to fulfill their cause or desires\r\n",
    "the water in the pot in a fixed sign gets spoiled or it gets fermented that's\r\n",
    "why kumba is a very much linked to the you know fermentation process of the food\r\n",
    "and the drinks so the fermented you know uh processes that are used for the\r\n",
    "medicine as well so alcohol as well you know the whole jala dosha is basically this problem\r\n",
    "that kumba is having you know how to fulfill your desires and not get support not\r\n",
    "spoil emotions in the process then uh next in the\r\n",
    "next inner line is makara and we say that the makara\r\n",
    "has an indra dosha so the planet showing the dosha is jupiter but the dosha is that of indra devi in\r\n",
    "the deva and we say that you know indra is the king and the king of the senses\r\n",
    "so the tenth house natural tenth house in kalapurusha or makkara is uh is a sign that can be\r\n",
    "uh that can show a state of the affairs where there is no king there is there are no rules or\r\n",
    "there there is no direction and or the ones one who is losing senses\r\n",
    "again a good homework is to find you know how the story from the purana how about how uh indra lost his senses\r\n",
    "and as a result of that certain things happened to him so makara carries indradoja\r\n",
    "and it shows the state of where the you know a person can feel like without direction and a person can\r\n",
    "lose their senses so it's like like an indra so it also\r\n",
    "means that you know a person can you know um so what helps lose the\r\n",
    "senses one of the things that is very typical for makara is uh you know um alcohol consumption\r\n",
    "so alcohol does that that you know it um how to say uh\r\n",
    "[Music] you know dulls your senses yeah it tells your senses and your uh\r\n",
    "limits and uh you know person you know if you say for makara you know you will draw a drone your own\r\n",
    "sorrows in alcohol so that is the issue in the dosha with the makarashi\r\n",
    "next in line i've just noticed the question yes vishnu purana has majority of the stories i don't uh\r\n",
    "i cannot recall if exactly agni dosha as well but yes please look there\r\n",
    "and when you find the story you know please share it on on the telegram for the benefit of\r\n",
    "everyone okay next in line for dhanu we say it's\r\n",
    "the vishnu dosha the planet indicating dosha is that is buddha but the the deva that is being angered\r\n",
    "is vishnu and why we say uh why this happened to\r\n",
    "dhanu and it is because uh you know we say that um\r\n",
    "vishnu is a shanta karana the one who wants peace and wise at the same time\r\n",
    "there is a conflict of dhanu being the battlefield and when we say battlefield we also mean a battlefield where you know\r\n",
    "about good and wrong you know it's a dharma but what is dharma really but you know concluding you know is this\r\n",
    "a good thing for uh is this a good deed or not is this right or is this wrong\r\n",
    "and daniel ascendants or donald wagner have this issue and that is that you know they are\r\n",
    "very much into you know good and bad you know is this right and wrong that's why they can come out as you know preachy you know\r\n",
    "and kuroji mentions you know once you know he mentioned how you know dano basically talks about how\r\n",
    "you know many of the wars or most of the wars were you know the excuse was religion which also belongs to the\r\n",
    "ninth house but he urges to think about in this way\r\n",
    "it is it could be religious or dharmic thing that makes us uh uh that makes people\r\n",
    "think that it is right to go to the war it is right to fight certain things but he also\r\n",
    "tells that that's the front and the on the back and it is always rajas so it is always the rajas that is the\r\n",
    "kurds so the king always wants something and that is either buddha or sukra the two planets\r\n",
    "representing rajas so if there is a war it could be because of this right or wrong\r\n",
    "in whatever you know sense but at the back end of that it's either money you know buddha rajas\r\n",
    "or wanting acquire more land or more money or more resources whatever it is\r\n",
    "or shukra a better relationship diplomatic relationship you know borders with uh with with\r\n",
    "a countrymen etc so the dosha that danu really carries with himself\r\n",
    "is that that you know even though we are all one family you know the vasudeva contour become\r\n",
    "principal of vishnu you know danu tends to uh to have this you know is this right and\r\n",
    "wrong and that that is uh yeah that's one other thing another thing is also\r\n",
    "that i have written here shanta karana versus anger da no has a lot of anger and that can\r\n",
    "that make him come as a surprise to some you know we eulogize dhanu because\r\n",
    "it's a ninth house and it's loaded by jupiter and all these things but it is\r\n",
    "an agni rashi and it has a lot of anger and that anger comes\r\n",
    "as a result of the curse of a vishnu okay then next in line is tula\r\n",
    "and tula is uh said to have mars dosha or mars as a planet indicates the dosha\r\n",
    "but the devata that is angered is kanda some secretary or scandal so the the\r\n",
    "lists of adidas and prada pratya devatas is something that we are going to be studying\r\n",
    "you know in a in an uh two or three webinars from now so uh it is kanda dosha and that means\r\n",
    "that the tula by nature has this you know the uh the anger\r\n",
    "you know anger and that's interesting because in one on one hand you know atula is\r\n",
    "striving to balance to equality and all these things on the other hand it is the natural seventh house in the\r\n",
    "horoscope in the in the color purusha it's the seventh house and you know it's both things basically you\r\n",
    "know the the tula ascendants will have you know this anger that comes as a\r\n",
    "result of the dosha of the skanda so example that guruji that guruji gave\r\n",
    "here was that you know when there is a prosperity that is indicated by tula you know there are many projects that\r\n",
    "are related to tula including diwali and all the other pujas that that celebrate the prosperity\r\n",
    "the prayers for the prosperity all they're all related to the tula so when there is a prosperity in society\r\n",
    "you know then there is no need for army you know there's no need for army and their\r\n",
    "their their weapons get rusted and the uh the god of war or skanda got angry\r\n",
    "so they say that you know and then of course there is a tussle between you know where do you put your fans are you\r\n",
    "putting your funds to prosperity or the war and so the whole story about the war versus\r\n",
    "prosperity is really in a tula also when we talk about the tula\r\n",
    "they say that a really good saying that belongs there to this rashi and to this lagna is that it's all\r\n",
    "fair in love and war you know that the whole principle is really tula\r\n",
    "then uh next sign is kanya and we say that the kanya\r\n",
    "carries the brahmadosha and the planet indicating this in the chart is saturn\r\n",
    "so brahma dosha is is a clear one you know brahma the uh what brahma is interested in\r\n",
    "is the creation its population or uh reproduction so the\r\n",
    "and that has uh has no place to be where there is you know a virgin girl or\r\n",
    "a purity so there is this you know purity versus impurity uh battle going on in kanye\r\n",
    "so interestingly you know you uh um i i have we i have two sons that are\r\n",
    "born as kanya lagna and they are both very peculiar about the cleanliness so you will see that the kanye lagos for\r\n",
    "example they are very peculiar about that you know is it clean is it clean enough\r\n",
    "what is clean you know those those are the topics that's the dosha that is that is present there and\r\n",
    "then mituna finally uh mituna is the last sign that indicates dosha we\r\n",
    "say that carries lakshmi dosha and the planet indicating this is shukra so\r\n",
    "and i've written here it's a bullocker problem now the reason why i've written it here\r\n",
    "is that um if we do divide the zodiac so if you look at yeah i can show mouse\r\n",
    "great if we divide zodiac in a three part you remember we divided you know the zodiac\r\n",
    "in swagger you know the three manifested lokas\r\n",
    "so the poor uh buu loka is from mesha till uh karka\r\n",
    "then from uh simha tidano is bubba and then svarga sorry promesha tilkarka\r\n",
    "is buloka from simchat in rishiker\r\n",
    "so if you look in this three locus then we see that in buloka where we are you know here on\r\n",
    "the planet earth there is only one rashi that really carries a dosha or a flow of brahma and\r\n",
    "that is me tuna so guruji oops sorry uh guruji concludes that you know\r\n",
    "really on here on a planet earth the dominant dosha is that of\r\n",
    "shukra and you know you can attach the the meaning to that it's about the\r\n",
    "population it's about the uh maituna baba being discriminative in\r\n",
    "that or not now how do we use that um main uh\r\n",
    "um one of the main things uh where one of the main things where we use this is really when analyzing ascendant and\r\n",
    "this is something that we we will study when we come to the uh baba and bavaisha so when studying\r\n",
    "ascendant when we see a person is born under one of these rashes that carry a dosha\r\n",
    "that we we uh that is you know a red flag for us to see aha so let's say amitu na mithulla lagna\r\n",
    "was born then we need to see what is it that sukra does in a chart so for example if we are looking for the\r\n",
    "help of shukraf if we are looking for the uh you know let's see a remedy from shukra or something like that then we\r\n",
    "would be interested to know if this is a meteorologist or any other lagna because in some charts it will say okay\r\n",
    "but there is a benefit there it can help us help us you know it can take us out of this problem\r\n",
    "but in case of uh shukra and mitu nalagna it may not because you know the uh this\r\n",
    "sun cased lakshmi dosha and chakra may not be willing to help as much\r\n",
    "so this is something that uh that we will cover again when we talk about the ascendants\r\n",
    "another thing is that what i was mentioning and that is the remedies you know for some of these signs planets\r\n",
    "that are indicating dosha may not be as beneficial than you would expect\r\n",
    "so i was just reading here and arjun says yes i'm done and lots of anger yeah i get that\r\n",
    "me too and you know it's uh it's a righteous anger so the anger that danu has is not the\r\n",
    "same anger that uh let's say a masha would have the anger that donald\r\n",
    "has is the righteous singer it's as uh it's you know i know i'm\r\n",
    "right you know how dare you you know it's a and the and because it's that type of\r\n",
    "anger it's justified you know you feel that it is justified at the ultimate level it's not you know\r\n",
    "people uh uh it doesn't matter which you know if you talk about the ninth house in the\r\n",
    "religion and you know the the concept of vasudev uh yeah a concept of vishnu\r\n",
    "then it really doesn't matter in which church where we are going or how are we praying or how are we\r\n",
    "dressing or how we are talking to the elders and all these things\r\n",
    "but you know donald will find i you know we will find a cause to anger as in you know how dare\r\n",
    "you you know to approach elders that way or behave like that in church and stuff\r\n",
    "like that so yeah that's the that's the anger of danu\r\n",
    "uh then i'll just read a few questions that came after this slide before we\r\n",
    "move on are the same doshas seen from chandra lagna\r\n",
    "who yes and uh yes but you know i for that to make any\r\n",
    "sense to to you guys you you will need to know how to see you know chandralana\r\n",
    "so there's okay so let's spend some time there many times you know you'll see that guruji says\r\n",
    "you know uh just this you can see the chart from lagna and you can see the chart from chandralana and you can see in the\r\n",
    "see the chart from karakala as well and that is your atmakaraka and so on and so on but when guruji says\r\n",
    "you know you can see them just you know chandra and\r\n",
    "uh ascendant you know he doesn't he means yes you can see those things but not in the same way\r\n",
    "so the way to really you know uh have benefit from this is this you know\r\n",
    "you need to understand what is lagna and what is chandralangna so lagna is really all about the brain\r\n",
    "all about your d in intelligence so all of those places is basically you know how is our\r\n",
    "brain computing things in life but the chandraland works differently and the houses from\r\n",
    "chandralana are seen differently so yes we do see them but we see them in a different way\r\n",
    "it's kind of like you know it's uh it's the way how our brain is built and that is something\r\n",
    "you will learn over time and that is just because it can be seen from both lagna and chandra lagna\r\n",
    "that doesn't mean that they're you know on the same level it just means it can be seen but\r\n",
    "comparative to the concept that you're looking at so yeah we will study chandraland i will\r\n",
    "mention this again when we do body parts because body parts are\r\n",
    "uh different from lagna that we learn from in color purusha than from chandralanga and that's because we see\r\n",
    "different things from lagna and body parts than that from chandralana and body parts\r\n",
    "okay what about kumba and mina uh\r\n",
    "yeah what about them i i don't understand what's what was the question please write the question\r\n",
    "then regina does the pramadosha play out only for lagna or also from\r\n",
    "for moon signs as in uh when you say moonsand you mean like\r\n",
    "uh russia in which moon is placed as chandralana then i then i've answered that already\r\n",
    "their doshas i couldn't get so well aha you you you've gotten something from\r\n",
    "that and that's good then then he says if someone has marcin\r\n",
    "tula and shukren mituna how would you read this we'll get there\r\n",
    "when we know how to read the graha in russia\r\n",
    "also when you as soon as you mention these two things mars in tula and shukra and mithuna you're already\r\n",
    "talking about the yogas and you know what yoga are they forming so this is something that\r\n",
    "that's gonna this is something that we will learn later on\r\n",
    "shankar says shankara teresa is interesting chandra is about manas and i thought lagna was physical\r\n",
    "manifestation yeah that is true\r\n",
    "then uh natalia if me tuna if mintuna has lakshmi dosha means that the person wants to enjoy too\r\n",
    "much um yeah if uh it also means that you know the emotions\r\n",
    "can run really high uh you know what is lakshmi dosha you know it's it's uh shukra is still a jala\r\n",
    "planet so those emotions or you know first you know there could be some\r\n",
    "strong urges for uh you know uh for my tuna the copulation process\r\n",
    "process that's one thing another thing is you know the emotion you know attachment to relationship because when\r\n",
    "shukra shows when we talk about the chakra and emotions we are talking about the conditioned emotions and that is falling\r\n",
    "in love expectations in relationship stuff like that so yeah there is also an enjoyment part\r\n",
    "to it\r\n",
    "uh so millin says for meena pranayama was advised do we have\r\n",
    "something similar for jala dosha in kumba\r\n",
    "well not like that i will need to think about that i'll\r\n",
    "need to think about that in general when we have uh issues now\r\n",
    "this is not specific now right now we're talking about the rushes and very clearly only rushes\r\n",
    "and the reason why we do that is because we really need to know rashes before we can add other things on\r\n",
    "top of that otherwise we get you know what you know a hodgepodge of everything so guruji specifically mentioned based\r\n",
    "on the pranic story of pranayama for meena for kumba and makkara those two signs\r\n",
    "you know are really also when you when a person has issues with those two signs or with their lords\r\n",
    "pranayama is advised as well and that is because saturn is of via tatwa\r\n",
    "but we are going to cover that later [Music]\r\n",
    "arjun says can we say placement of graha in russia where they represent\r\n",
    "dosha are not good uh no we we don't do that it's like this you know when um\r\n",
    "when these rushes were created you know there was no um it's a brahma\r\n",
    "dosha in a sense that when they were created there was no a clear picture of it now\r\n",
    "how do i explain this better so let me tell you this example when um i was somebody mentioned that so\r\n",
    "you probably guys know that i i've written a book on rashes and it was a commentary on uh\r\n",
    "jataka parijata so the idea for that was that i wanted a person you know somebody\r\n",
    "i knew was very talented to create these rashes to be as\r\n",
    "close as possible to what we have learned you know in jotis you know so there are\r\n",
    "vedic signs and it was very interesting process so this person who i was telling\r\n",
    "you know i was telling her how this russian needs to look so for each and every of the rashes\r\n",
    "where you know it they don't they that don't have a dosha you know we got the picture right away\r\n",
    "so she draw it i was very happy with it we moved on but for each and every of the signs that\r\n",
    "have a dosha we had you know several attempts to get it and it's very interesting that\r\n",
    "is brahmadosha they you know when i was telling her how they are supposed to look\r\n",
    "the image was still not clear so even for example let's take mituna\r\n",
    "you know there is there are so many ways of describing amituna for example you\r\n",
    "know i've chosen for that of chosen for that book to be you know to a boy and a girl\r\n",
    "because i thought that makes more sense because they're they're playful and mituna shows a playground\r\n",
    "it shows the places of the of the parting you know for grown-ups it can be a\r\n",
    "bordell a casino you know uh for uh for children it's a playground all of that is in amituna\r\n",
    "so all those layers are basically in that one in the same rashi so um there are so many ways to present\r\n",
    "that so no wonder you know there is there there was a dosha then creating them\r\n",
    "there was not one energy there was similar energy there so that is really about the\r\n",
    "creation of the rashi it is not it does not give anything to if a planet\r\n",
    "is in that rashi in that sense if i go to your question right\r\n",
    "okay i'm gonna come back to the to the questions i can see there are many let's uh let's answer\r\n",
    "some other things that we need to do our time is running and then i'm going to come back to questions don't worry i'll answer all of\r\n",
    "them so this next slide was basically i was you can take a a um a note of this slide later on a\r\n",
    "screenshot or something so the what was interesting what was important for me to note is that\r\n",
    "uh or to you for you to understand that uh that yeah the rashi whose picture is not\r\n",
    "clearly specified has a dosha of law of creation guruji uh mentioned or references that when he\r\n",
    "talks about advaita and white rashes and it's important to know that five signs\r\n",
    "have no dosha but sevens seven of them have and those seven planets\r\n",
    "you know from sun till saturn are the planets that will carry the dosha or show the dosha in a\r\n",
    "chart so this is what was written here underneath\r\n",
    "okay so here there were not many questions but there were a few that i wanted to clarify that i that you mentioned in a\r\n",
    "group or in an email so about the about the colors so one of\r\n",
    "the things was about the colors uh and that is you know we know that mesha\r\n",
    "is a blood red or a dark red or we even say it's a royal red you know\r\n",
    "the royal red you know royal families use it a lot then rishaba is not just white it's also\r\n",
    "a milk white you know that's an additional you know energy of of uh brishaba\r\n",
    "then me tuna is green and you know all the shades of green then car can\r\n",
    "seem something that you were asking about so carca is b is basically white with a\r\n",
    "tinge of red so you get the pinkish color light pink color white simcha is similarly\r\n",
    "white with a with a tinge of yellow so you get an off-white color you know like a sand\r\n",
    "white then kanye is a virgo kanye\r\n",
    "is a gray and i've a nice reference for that was you know\r\n",
    "guruji was talking about how intestines are you know placed in a uh body here where\r\n",
    "the body part is virgo and uh uh how in the intestine the\r\n",
    "process of um what's the name discerning of what is what is to be kept for the body and what\r\n",
    "is to be uh uh what is to be a waste is happening here so this is the kanya and the gray\r\n",
    "color tula is black there is no doubt about that rishika and dhanos are two\r\n",
    "colors that you mentioned uh you know the uh guruji keeps on\r\n",
    "mentioning that and that is that scorpio is a light yellow and danu\r\n",
    "is a dark yellow or turmeric yellow or golden yellow now he also mentions for scorpio that\r\n",
    "you know because of ketu there is a brownish brown color here so that is also there\r\n",
    "makara looks a bit light blue here but makara is really in a dark blue it's that industrial color if\r\n",
    "you come from a country like i come from you know uh you know all communist country you\r\n",
    "know they would have like uh uniforms for going to work or kids would have uniforms to go to school\r\n",
    "they they were always dark uh dark blue so that makes perfect sense\r\n",
    "cumber is a uh purple and that's mainly because of rahu and\r\n",
    "that's basically you know showing that process of fermenting or creating poisons or creating medicines\r\n",
    "and mina is a light blue and we say it's a it's a sky blue\r\n",
    "so that was about the colors i know you you asked about that now about the body part you know this uh\r\n",
    "we say that you know uh the uh the god has manifested as kala purusha\r\n",
    "you know he has manifested as a time or kala and uh and um\r\n",
    "to to how to say uh to help those in need you know the\r\n",
    "word used was janadana to help those as an answer to those who who cry or uh who suffer\r\n",
    "so one of the things that that are that were mentioned in a in the lesson was that you know\r\n",
    "that you can always call him that's one of the um meanings of this\r\n",
    "and the other meaning is um that we are basically made as an uh based on the template of god so\r\n",
    "you know just like you know uh kala purusha chart has this this how to say uh division of\r\n",
    "the body parts so is also in our chart so when we say a natural chart or color\r\n",
    "purusha chart this is what we are referring to and that is that you know aries is always the first house\r\n",
    "and taurus is always the second house gemini the third house and so on and so so forth and the first house always\r\n",
    "represents a head second house face and neck third house\r\n",
    "arm and shoulders you know if you stretch your arms you know in with that that is the region you know\r\n",
    "arms and shoulders that then uh of cancer shows the chest\r\n",
    "and heart and breast area seeing how shows stomach and liver and\r\n",
    "so on you can see all those body parts now the only except the only interesting\r\n",
    "exception to this and that was uh indicated in this picture in a way\r\n",
    "is that you know two body parts that are connected to the kettle are not\r\n",
    "vertical but they're horizontal so the sign that is loaded by or colloded\r\n",
    "by ketu is rishika or ali and that is the those are those inner\r\n",
    "or hidden parts hidden genitalia so that's inwards so that's horizontal and\r\n",
    "feet and mina is the other sign lorded by ketu in a sense that that is his\r\n",
    "office that is where he goes to work so in a sense he also lords mina\r\n",
    "and because you know over time we also learn ketu has this nature of reversing everything you know so he in comparison\r\n",
    "to all the body parts ketu reverses that instead of them standing vertically they stand horizontally it's same in for\r\n",
    "example when when deciding you know the directions the world directions the eight plane directions are plane\r\n",
    "directions but the kettle will always show vertically upwards or opposite of that\r\n",
    "so yeah i believe we've answered those questions here um\r\n",
    "now guna okay this is important this this kind of created a lots of confusion with uh uh\r\n",
    "russian laguna and uh basically the confusion uh arises\r\n",
    "because there are two systems you know there is a first system of\r\n",
    "deciding the uh guna of the rashi is based on the way they were created you know the objective\r\n",
    "of rashi so we say that you know the those rashes those that are chara or movable\r\n",
    "are also having the rajas gona then and those are these uh depending on\r\n",
    "the char that you are using so these these four mesha\r\n",
    "are four movable uh or chara rashes and they are also known to be of the\r\n",
    "rajas guna and that is because of the energy that they are created with you know the nation are created with the\r\n",
    "excess energy the they are constantly spending they're constantly creating they're in a constant moment\r\n",
    "and then you know we have four rashes that are stera or fixed and those are rishaba simcha\r\n",
    "scorpio or ali and kumba and those rashes are said to be you know\r\n",
    "in a inert you know fixed or stale and they have the energy of the rudra\r\n",
    "and then you know just like the chatter actually have the energy of the brahma the stirarashi have the energy of the\r\n",
    "rudra and then the last are the three dual signs and those are\r\n",
    "mituna and those are known to have both or the\r\n",
    "combination or the balance between the chara and the stirarashi\r\n",
    "so they're not as you know i've remembered one of the questions was mituna probably has a bit more of the\r\n",
    "chara because of being in one of the biorushes that's not the case based on the creation on the creation\r\n",
    "the dual signs have the balance of the two so they have bought the\r\n",
    "mobile part in them and they have you know the balance of the two yeah that's the best and those are known as vishnu\r\n",
    "signs so we say when you talk about the guna we say that\r\n",
    "the chara are that of the rajas and the stira\r\n",
    "are tamas and the dual signs are satwa or those in balance\r\n",
    "now where do we see you know where does the confusion arises\r\n",
    "it is that when we and when we introduce the lordship of all the\r\n",
    "all the signs that we get confused so and i would i would suggest that you\r\n",
    "think about it just as a layered information of the russians it's just uh it's like this you know if i uh\r\n",
    "own a house you know if i as a bronco with my personality own a house that house will show\r\n",
    "you know it will reflect the my nature so you know the person who owns a property\r\n",
    "you know the nature of that person will also reflect in his property the way the choice of the house the way\r\n",
    "it's maintained the what is being prioritized big windows or place for kids or you know\r\n",
    "library and all these things so the lord of the house will have its say when it comes to the\r\n",
    "guna of the rashi so we need to at this stage we will need to say what are the uh\r\n",
    "you know what are the kunas of all the planets so the south fukuna planets are said to be guru or jupiter\r\n",
    "moon or chandra and sun surya so those three planets are\r\n",
    "satwaguna planets so they will add satwa to the signs\r\n",
    "that are that they're lording over then the two rajas planets are buddha mercury and\r\n",
    "shukra venus and then the thomas planets\r\n",
    "are saturn and mars so now what do how do we really how do\r\n",
    "we really read this and one of the ways for example if we take measure and we know that the measure by\r\n",
    "nature by its creation by the energy level you know is chara which shows that he's rajas\r\n",
    "so meisha people for example if you're talking about the lagna mesha people are people who have lots of\r\n",
    "energy they have lots of rajas they have immediate desires or urges and\r\n",
    "they uh they want they can be creative they they are used they are said to be a pioneers\r\n",
    "you know so that is the energy of the measure they're going front you know that is the\r\n",
    "energy of the measure that comes from the russia and the creation of the rashi but then what does the lord which is\r\n",
    "mars which is thomas gonna tell about this sign it tells that you know mars is the\r\n",
    "thomas guna tamas is the uh kuna which shows either ignorance or stagnity or uh you know being in a\r\n",
    "dark you know or being a lazy which means that so when we combine those two things i\r\n",
    "mean we can say that the measure is the sign that has a lots of energy can be very you know can be as a\r\n",
    "soldier can be very uh task oriented you know but they can also be uh lazy or\r\n",
    "uninformed and because of that they may not achieve much you know so it depends what is the uh\r\n",
    "uh what is the lord giving to the sign in a sense so a really good idea for you guys would\r\n",
    "be take to take uh guruji's book uh kova crux of medical astrology i think\r\n",
    "that it's a chapter three where in which guruji uh tells explains the nature\r\n",
    "and the attributes uh of all the twelve rushes and then for example he would say let's\r\n",
    "say meisha rashi is a a pioneer it's one of the first ones it can be\r\n",
    "very stubborn or headstrong and that is because you know make sure they're really going you\r\n",
    "know head first you know and um they can be really good and execute executing things\r\n",
    "and when you read all of that that guruji made a list of the positive attributes of the measure\r\n",
    "and negative attributes of the measure then based on that you can conclude that you know it really that kuruchi\r\n",
    "took all the information about the rashi and information about the lord of the\r\n",
    "rashi to come to those you know ready-made results if you may\r\n",
    "so for example one of the one of the things that we talked about when i talked about the guna and there was a confusion there\r\n",
    "was about the kanya sukanya on its own or or per creation and the energy level\r\n",
    "is satwa but then kanye also has a lord which is called\r\n",
    "buddha which is rajas and another lord which is called rahu because this is\r\n",
    "also rahu's multi-corner or office sign now don't get confused about this additional lordship that i'm\r\n",
    "mentioning because this is something that you're going to do when we go to graha but just so you know so there are\r\n",
    "several uh gunas at play here so what do we really do when we see a chart and we are when we\r\n",
    "ask if we are judging the the the kanye and for example let's say it's a it's a kanye wagner\r\n",
    "we will see which is the stronger is it buddha stronger and dominating the sign or is it rahu stronger and dominating\r\n",
    "the sign which planets are dominating the sign is it going more towards the radius or is\r\n",
    "it going more towards the tamas okay i hope this makes it\r\n",
    "yeah i hope this i hope this makes it um you know uh easy to understand now there\r\n",
    "was um there was something very interesting i wanted to show to you guys and that is something that i've learned\r\n",
    "about the about the um uh palm or the hand and for that i'll\r\n",
    "need to come out of these just a second\r\n",
    "now okay i'm gonna show you at the end anyway let's let's try and move cover other things\r\n",
    "okay so this is the uh division to purusha and street and to krura and\r\n",
    "akura or krura insomnia so just as for the grahas we have you know uh\r\n",
    "shuba and ashu bashuba and papa then same thing for the rashi based on the oddity of the sign you know\r\n",
    "is it being uh we know if those signs are cruel signs meaning they have a male energy or for\r\n",
    "even signs we know that there are so many signs and they have a female energy so when we talk about this division of\r\n",
    "you know krura and samia we are talking about the uh the oddity so for example all male and\r\n",
    "uh all male signs and those are all odd signs\r\n",
    "and those are mesha mituna simha tula dano and kumba they are said to be\r\n",
    "by nature more crude and what is scruta it really means that you know those\r\n",
    "signs are more aggressive or they are more assertive or they are\r\n",
    "more like extrovert they are more outspoken so when we say cruda we don't\r\n",
    "necessarily mean you know we don't talk about good and bad we just talk about the nature what what\r\n",
    "are they by nature and then in the same way the even signs are\r\n",
    "rishaba karka kanya ali nakra and mina they are said to be somia or\r\n",
    "they have more female energy which means by nature they are more passive they are more\r\n",
    "introverted they are more into sustaining than asserting themselves\r\n",
    "so this is something that we use later on for like for several things like one of\r\n",
    "one of the things is you know let's say the first thing that came to\r\n",
    "mind is the champion when we go in the second year and judge the chart\r\n",
    "based on the fact if you are being born with the lagna being you know old sign or even\r\n",
    "sign you will be you know prone to look and listen to the advisor people or not\r\n",
    "so for example those who are born with uh old signs in the dasha lagna are more\r\n",
    "prone to you know make their own decisions and make their own mistakes you know they're they're more prone to\r\n",
    "you know be independent in their decision making but those that are that are born with\r\n",
    "even signs are more prone to ask for a advice you know ask for guidance or relying on\r\n",
    "somebody for the guidance it's not only used there it's used in multiples of ways you know it's it's\r\n",
    "used for the dasha reckoning it's used for when we start you know sting charts to see\r\n",
    "are we supposed to look you know front or back you know there's so many things there so at this\r\n",
    "stage we are just introducing that rushes they do have these qualities and then as we go we are gonna refer to those\r\n",
    "qualities and say because of that now we are seeing the child from this house and not that house\r\n",
    "etc now this should not be mistaken by the male and female sign in a sense\r\n",
    "of deciding if the uh the sex of the child you know if the child would be you know a boy or a girl\r\n",
    "this is not uh what we use uh uh there so for deciding of the sex first it's\r\n",
    "important to know that to decide the the sex of the child we can only do that in the septame chart or\r\n",
    "the vaga that covers the uh the whole area of the cha of the children in life but you know uh\r\n",
    "what we do is that there is there is a small variation to what we have learned here\r\n",
    "and that is that uh mituna and karka they exchange\r\n",
    "and that is you know karka is a too strong of a sign it is said to be too strong of a sign\r\n",
    "and because of that karka will show a boy and mituna girl so these two exchange and same goes for\r\n",
    "uh kumba and mina so they say that the mina is too strong of the of the sign to show uh\r\n",
    "it's too strong of a sign to show a girl so instead you know meena even though it's an even sign will show a boy\r\n",
    "and cumberbush or girl okay\r\n",
    "for you guys for you garages i wouldn't be spending much time here guruji just kind of indicated where\r\n",
    "where uh where we can use it so longevity this is later on in a course\r\n",
    "then um the dasher periods again later in the course\r\n",
    "but this would be interesting for you and that is something that we talked about it so this yoga rashes they talk about\r\n",
    "how is how much light there is in those rashes how much sat uh how much dharma is basically the\r\n",
    "division how much dharma how much light and how much support so when we have planets you know in\r\n",
    "krita orashis then you know it is said that things come easily a person\r\n",
    "easily gets the knowledge you know and you know i i think you know it was in our lesson\r\n",
    "that guruji was asking me about where my ninth lord is so i happen to have you know amaba\r\n",
    "satitti in the ninth house in the simharashi in both cases it's rashi and the house\r\n",
    "that are indicating the satya yoga so i had good luck to to get the\r\n",
    "knowledge about it to get the remedies about it to get the understanding about it not that the yoga is not in the ninth\r\n",
    "house it all works it's just that you know i got critically apprecia pretty\r\n",
    "fast in life the solutions for it so this is creator you know things come easily or um\r\n",
    "yeah so you get the gist you know treta rashi you know 75 of what satya or krita rashi would show\r\n",
    "it it means you know you need to put some effort but the things still get to happen you know you still get some\r\n",
    "support you know and and so on you know same logic for trapper and kali rashi\r\n",
    "we use this a lot when we come to the chat to see how things are easy or difficult\r\n",
    "to see how much support in a human you know human power we have how much support in\r\n",
    "knowledge and stuff like that so this is very useful and uh over time you'll see how we use\r\n",
    "it uh practice this is this is an easy one\r\n",
    "i wouldn't be spending time this is important i know guys i'm keeping you sorry for that but this\r\n",
    "would be the last slide for today and this is because guruji didn't teach this\r\n",
    "in in a slide and i think it's important so um kuroji made this beautiful image for us\r\n",
    "where he divided zodiac you know in two halves uh and this is the south\r\n",
    "indian and in the north indian whichever you watch and there are two things that are easily\r\n",
    "described here one is the understanding of the planetary cabinet and that is that uh let's say you know\r\n",
    "the sun and the moon we know their their uh sun is the king and the moon is his queen and they share\r\n",
    "their share their uh they share their quarters are next to each other so\r\n",
    "king and queen they stay next to each other right next to them is there on both side is there their\r\n",
    "prince or a princess so some says the prince on one side and princess on the other side\r\n",
    "either way buddha will show a prince or the child and on both sides if you look from the\r\n",
    "sun you know there is a buddha which is the next in line to have their rooms and uh and from the moon as well then the\r\n",
    "next line in this you know planetary cabinet those are all the ladies invading or the\r\n",
    "all the ladies that are you know part of the of the house about a part of the um\r\n",
    "what's the name a kingdom let's say you know so uh same from the sun and same from the\r\n",
    "moon so third third in line is ruled by shukra from the moon and from the sun\r\n",
    "then come all the gentlemen of the of the court all the nights and all the protection\r\n",
    "and all the um yeah the guards basically and that is fought from the king and\r\n",
    "forth from the queen and then next in line is a jupiter and that those are all the advisors you\r\n",
    "know jupiter shows the advisors the ministers the priests and you know you will see that for\r\n",
    "example same you know there's a uh from the sun jupiter in dano would be the priest and\r\n",
    "advisor which means that the son normally only takes the advice from the\r\n",
    "from the priest or the highest priest why is the moon has a different type of the advisors\r\n",
    "it's jupiter and mena it's more about a broad picture it's more about about you know\r\n",
    "the life part and then lastly the last in line in the kingdom\r\n",
    "from the king is the saturn and those are all the all the workers or commoners or\r\n",
    "you know the labor force and same goes from the moon so this way we describe you know the\r\n",
    "this is one of the one of the ways to depict the lordship of the signs so the first\r\n",
    "sign from the um so you would see you know based on the\r\n",
    "uh that how you know planets are ruling the same same places from both\r\n",
    "the king and the queen so that's one way of seeing seeing this another way of seeing this\r\n",
    "is that if we know that when we see the chart we are not seeing from the sun we are\r\n",
    "seeing from the earth so we are having the geocentrical view and we\r\n",
    "replace earth with the sun here then we see you know what is the you know the speed of the planet\r\n",
    "and you will notice that this lordship of the signs is based on the speed of the planets so\r\n",
    "the fastest planet to the earth is then a moon and then it comes buddha and then\r\n",
    "sukra and then mangal and then guru and shani so this is two two ways to remember the\r\n",
    "lordship of our signs of course we'll t we will talk about this again when we do\r\n",
    "navagraha when we do navagraha then you know we'll again speak about all the\r\n",
    "planets and then they their lordship over science but from that angle as well\r\n",
    "and also yeah i was just reading you know shankar atreya though the ownership is anti-clockwise\r\n",
    "exactly so from sun it goes always clockwise from moon it goes anti-clockwise\r\n",
    "so from there we have other principle from old signs we go clockwise from even signs we go\r\n",
    "anti-clockwise and so on and so forth when we go to the dasher and when you go to the marker\r\n",
    "then we will see application of all of these in the charts\r\n",
    "okay guys i will stop the share now\r\n",
    "so i just want to read this last question from arjun can we say mercury from sun\r\n",
    "means communication regarding work and mercury from moon becomes gossip uh\r\n",
    "yeah yeah we can it's uh you know it would be interesting for you also to see you know\r\n",
    "all of these planets you know buddha in kanya which is exalted buddha versus buddha in its own sign\r\n",
    "you know shook out these ladies you know the court ladies in tula versus court ladies in rishaba\r\n",
    "so those in tula will be more about you know tula is all about and shukra all about the vastra or the\r\n",
    "garments you know and it shows we say it shows the gentlemanly behavior you know how are you standing and how are you dressing\r\n",
    "properly with sugar and bishop will be more about you know jewels and you know the the um jewelry\r\n",
    "the uh what's the name um yeah you get the gist then interestingly you know mars here as\r\n",
    "a as a knight or a guard you know it's not the same as the mars for for the queen\r\n",
    "so mars for or uh the guard for the sun is in rishika and there is a dual\r\n",
    "function there don't forget that the ketu is also loading this sign so all the spies on the top of all the\r\n",
    "guards and all the army are really a scene from the sun was from the moon is a straight guard\r\n",
    "you know she's not as involved in you know the politics you know and espionage and\r\n",
    "stuff like that so yeah okay i'll stop a share\r\n",
    "and i want to show you hi again i want to show you something\r\n",
    "very cool before we start can you hear me still\r\n",
    "yes please say yes in a chat yes okay perfect just one last thing i wanted to show you\r\n",
    "something really cool on my on my hand what a memory ad about uh how to how to remember the\r\n",
    "mobility of the signs you see the way i've learned it is that first\r\n",
    "the hand has a very strong it's a a connection to to our karma we know that and the concept of vishnu\r\n",
    "and if you look at my hand you will see that you know we have four fingers and with three parts each\r\n",
    "which which gives us 12 parts and then out of that we also get to learn you\r\n",
    "know different rushes in these 12 parts so there are two cool things that you can learn from\r\n",
    "here one is if i do this then there is something called samapada and vim sapada and that is you\r\n",
    "know sama pada is one two three so for example this is where you know uh misha is so one two three\r\n",
    "four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and then you will\r\n",
    "notice that the sama pada are basically one two three or first three signs and these three\r\n",
    "signs and memes apathetics in between but this is not what i wanted to show i wanted to show you something else and\r\n",
    "that is that all the chara signs then comes to be and come to be at the top of the fingers so\r\n",
    "this last the first part you know the mesha and the tula and karka and mito they're all sorry\r\n",
    "mesha tula kalkan makara they're all at the top and those are those are two and those are known to be chara\r\n",
    "they're moving the most they're doing all the karmas they're constantly experiencing something touching\r\n",
    "something you know creating something so that is the rajas the next in line\r\n",
    "is the rishaba simcha kumba and arishtika and those are fixed and they\r\n",
    "they are fixed on the finger they don't have that much of the there's no free will\r\n",
    "they are having the part on each side they are not deciding for themselves they are fixed and then the last in line those at the\r\n",
    "root of the of the each finger are the dual signs so the thing that i've learned from\r\n",
    "guruji when he was showing this is that it is the dual lagnas that are most\r\n",
    "controlling lagna's of them all did you know that so the dual lagnas are those loudness\r\n",
    "that are the root of these things and the way uh duolagna and is this could come as a surprise but the\r\n",
    "radiologness do that is in two ways so there are two lords of the dual lagnas\r\n",

    "derivation of katapayadi and everything but right now for this level we are just learning how to assign the\r\n",
    "numerical value to the uh to the uh consonant in order to to\r\n",
    "to gain the value of the the name so you see here there are uh values from\r\n",
    "0 to there are values from 0 to nine including zero\r\n",
    "and let's see so you see this the pa yeah when you see the the one\r\n",
    "is giving kata paya\r\n",
    "that is how the the name of varga is is gotten okay so here\r\n",
    "how it's done first what we need to to remember is if the\r\n",
    "vowels initiate the name then it's got value if it's not\r\n",
    "we are ignoring also the the\r\n",
    "i'm sorry that no not the consonant we are taking the syllables like k\r\n",

    "very important when it comes to when it's when it comes to caterpillar vaga you\r\n",
    "need to uh you need to to write down\r\n",
    "the name is it is spelled\r\n",
    "you know is how you are pronouncing it not spelled i'm sorry how you are pronouncing it\r\n",
    "that's a very very important thing it doesn't matter how the the you know\r\n",

    "the ten letters inside the name and it will be pronounced just three in sanskrit you are writing\r\n",

    "you see if the the consonants are conjoined with the letter\r\n",

    "k without ra\r\n",
    "okay so here you see in the table you're having the you're having the the\r\n",

    "we reverse that number\r\n",
    "then we reverse that number and then take out the multiplies\r\n",

    "the horizon is something where you horizontally you are\r\n",
    "able to see and horizon is based on the uh\r\n",
    "position of the observer okay everybody will will see different\r\n",
    "things uh everybody will see different things ahead but the the\r\n",
    "horizon is something where you are able to see where the the the earth and the sky\r\n",
    "is joining that is the horizon then it or mid heaven is\r\n",
    "something which is exactly 90 degrees above us\r\n",
    "the zenith is always based on the uh on the position of observer\r\n",
    "okay so udaya\r\n",
    "is the point on the eastern horizon at the time of somebody's birth\r\n",
    "is its sunrise is the the the rashi\r\n",
    "where the the sun is is on the eastern horizon okay\r\n",
    "so the the grahas are going around\r\n",
    "and they are taking their uh they are taking their\r\n",
    "just so the the grahas are going for example\r\n",
    "like this so the what they are they are going through horizon in one moment exact moment\r\n",
    "on the east will be the lagna\r\n",
    "in that movement of the grahas\r\n",
    "okay so and as hasta lagna is\r\n",
    "something which is 180 degrees\r\n",
    "from it okay so here is the lagna\r\n",
    "let's say and here is asta lagna the setting gasta simply means\r\n",
    "setting and udaya means rising we will come to all the bhavas to do\r\n",
    "okay and mc you see here mc is exactly on 90\r\n",
    "degrees from both of these nuts\r\n",
    "there they are uh 180 degrees apart\r\n",
    "and the zenith is exactly 90 degrees here is the the degree is 90.\r\n",
    "okay what i would what i would advise\r\n",
    "for for the people who are interested in to know more\r\n",
    "there is this uh stellarium uh software who\r\n",
    "where you can physically depict everything the movement of the planet the the\r\n",
    "planets the retrogression the creation of the nodes everything is depicted over there so so\r\n",
    "you can see it in 3d okay so\r\n",
    "and also what we need to to know uh is that uh there is this uh like this celestial\r\n",
    "sphere which is here there is also uh something called the uh ecliptic which\r\n",
    "is the horizontal plane between sun and the earth\r\n",
    "okay that is the eclipse so the planets will be in their positions\r\n",
    "above the ecliptic and below the ecliptic okay so what we are doing we are just\r\n",
    "projecting them on the ecliptic in order to take their differences because you you see here\r\n",
    "all of these here uh let's see when you put\r\n",
    "let's see here where i draw this line which is not so nice sorry\r\n",
    "so you see here\r\n",
    "so when we put on the horizon there is a\r\n",
    "so if here is north\r\n",
    "here will be west and the north will be\r\n",
    "the north will be zero degree\r\n",
    "or 360 or full\r\n",
    "okay the west will be 180 degrees\r\n",
    "and here again another one\r\n",
    "which will be\r\n",
    "east which is 90 degrees\r\n",
    "and south which is uh\r\n",
    "okay and this is how on the horizons when you project those\r\n",
    "planets which are above or below of the ecliptic when we project them we\r\n",
    "can decide what is what is the their position in degrees\r\n",
    "okay\r\n",
    "and\r\n",
    "and here we are having this you see this uh this red line\r\n",
    "is the ecliptic you see the movement of the sun is\r\n",
    "bringing the the horizontal plane in between sun and the earth which is\r\n",
    "forming the eclipse and that uh the movement\r\n",
    "of the of the graphs can be above and below\r\n",
    "that is why we are taking the that is why we are taking those\r\n",
    "projection inside this ecliptic here\r\n",
    "for example if some some graha is\r\n",
    "is here above we will project it\r\n",
    "we will project it down on the ecliptic straight away and from there take the\r\n",
    "and from there there take the exact degree of the longitude\r\n",
    "okay so and it's astronomy the the stellarium\r\n",
    "is really something that you can find the useful\r\n",
    "i'm sorry the yeah it should be north and south\r\n",
    "are 180 degrees and east and the west please uh i'm\r\n",
    "sorry for that a visit thank you yeah the the the north and the the\r\n",
    "north and the south are opposite each other yeah and uh\r\n",
    "east and the west are opposite each other comparing to to the previous stock okay\r\n",
    "and now uh yeah the the questions yeah now now we are coming to to uh the\r\n",
    "questions related to bhava chakra\r\n",
    "okay so what is bhava chakra here you see the bhava chakra\r\n",
    "is something which is made with the lagna degree\r\n",
    "okay so bhava chakra when you are creating baba chakra that means that you are\r\n",
    "taking the degree of the lagna and adding 15 degrees before\r\n",
    "and 15 degrees after\r\n",
    "and then getting uh another set of houses\r\n",
    "so i uh i created here you see the swami vivekananda is having\r\n",
    "lagna on 26 degree of danush\r\n",
    "so you see in this table here so the first\r\n",
    "house is getting from 11th degree of\r\n",
    "dhanu till 11 degree nakra or capricorn\r\n",
    "earlier it was the the lagna we we took one rashi one baba\r\n",
    "okay most of us we are using rashi chart rashi chart we\r\n",
    "are taking where the the mesha the the span\r\n",
    "of mesha will be in the first house for for mesha lagnas so one russia\r\n",
    "one house are equal now we are uh introducing the the new\r\n",
    "system where taking the exact position of lagna and creating 30 degrees out of it\r\n",
    "from both from both sides\r\n",
    "okay so you see in this case the the danush lagna is from\r\n",
    "but the the first house in bhava chakra is from 11th degree of\r\n",
    "danushatil 11th degree of uh nakra capricorn\r\n",
    "okay and then from 11th of nacra till\r\n",
    "it is the second house in bava chakra from 11th kumbha till 11th meena it is\r\n",
    "the third house in in baba chakra so all of these are followed from the 11th degree\r\n",
    "and we are getting rounding up the the 12 houses\r\n",
    "okay so you see now we are having uh\r\n",
    "the first row is rashi chart of swamiji and\r\n",
    "here are the degrees also of the graphs so the surya is\r\n",
    "inside the the range you see surya is on 20.\r\n",
    "chocolate is the same lagna yeah yeah will always be the same\r\n",
    "because we are taking the the the exact degree of lagna\r\n",
    "okay always be the same ragna but the the the grahas can\r\n",
    "shift so you see here the sun is in danish on 29 17 degrees so danish 29 something\r\n",
    "is inside the range of this eleven uh dhanush and eleven\r\n",
    "nakra so the sun is staying moon is the on 17 degrees\r\n",
    "so 17 is before so basically what we are\r\n",
    "here what we are seeking for is the grahas who are below 11 degrees\r\n",
    "of uh of sagittarius\r\n",
    "yeah yeah i'm coming to the tenth house\r\n",
    "so so you see uh\r\n",
    "the mangala is on six degree of measure\r\n",
    "so and in russia chart it is in the fifth house in bava lagna chart you will see\r\n",
    "that it's shifted to the fourth house because it is\r\n",
    "below this range so what your what we are determining is\r\n",
    "the boundaries in bava chart\r\n",
    "so here mangala changed uh changed the direction position\r\n",
    "and venus changed you see in baba lagna the venus is at seven\r\n",
    "degree of nakra in the second house seven degree is below\r\n",
    "is below this uh given so the the venus will come to the first\r\n",
    "house in bavar in bhava chakra\r\n",
    "chart you see and guru is in first\r\n",
    "four degrees of tula so guru also came into the tenth house\r\n",
    "okay\r\n",
    "so so is the the calculation of bava chakra clear\r\n",
    "so you take your lagna degree add 15 degrees before and 15 degrees after\r\n",
    "and for for baba uh for bhava chakra there will be complete lessons devoted\r\n",
    "uh to the baba chakra uh explanations okay\r\n",
    "so now we are coming to baloch elite\r\n",
    "chakra\r\n",
    "that which is moving that which is dynamic\r\n",
    "okay so in the in here we are taking\r\n",
    "the the we are taking degree of bava lagna\r\n",
    "and doing the same as we did with lagna the baba lagna is one of the vishesh\r\n",
    "lagnas there is baba lagna there is hora lagna there is uh\r\n",
    "gatika gothic there is prana padalangna all of those likeness we will learn so\r\n",
    "for bhavat chakra we are taking the bava lagna babalatna is something\r\n",
    "is the position in the chart the the baba lagna is going two hours\r\n",
    "through rashi so you find yourself above allah\r\n",
    "then create a chart based on that so you see here the the baba ragna in\r\n",
    "swamiji's case is on 25 degrees\r\n",
    "50 almost 26 degree so the same thing we did so uh you see 15\r\n",
    "degrees before and 15 degrees after\r\n",
    "okay and here when we are writing this\r\n",
    "uh this chart then we are not taking the lagna the usual udai\r\n",
    "lagna\r\n",
    "so baba lagna won't be the same as original lagne yes it can shift but\r\n",
    "what i'm just saying is that for calculation of bava lagna\r\n",
    "yes we are taking the actual degrees of the notes\r\n",
    "no that is what i'm saying the it's the lagna when you take bhava chalit chakra\r\n",
    "because we decided the starting point in bhava chakra that is the the\r\n",
    "difference between baba chakra and baba shalita chakra\r\n",
    "for baba chalit chakra the starting point is baba lagna\r\n",
    "i'm sagittarius lagna my baba lagna is in kumba\r\n",
    "in aquarius so the starting point for my bhava chalit chakra\r\n",
    "will be uh some nine degrees something of aquarius\r\n",
    "okay so we are not shifting lagna wagner cannot be shift but what we are\r\n",
    "we are not taking the the\r\n",
    "uh this is krishna so when we are starting from our original lagna and we want to\r\n",
    "create create our bhava chakra so we'll always start with our original lagna degrees\r\n",
    "as a starting point am i have i understood okay so my bhava lagna being the starting\r\n",
    "point for bhava chakra which is nothing but my original lagna no no no no i'm telling you\r\n",
    "is i started with that that baba lagna is one of the vichesha lagnas that we will learn so you see\r\n",
    "have you seen in the church that there is some bl inside or next to next in the\r\n",
    "data there is baba lagna and the baba lagna is coming together\r\n",
    "with hora lagna and gatika and pranapada lagnas okay okay okay i\r\n",
    "have a question if you go to a slide before this uh once we have calculated we still\r\n",
    "found that sagittarius is the lagna in bhava chakra\r\n",
    "it will always be the same lag because the starting point is lagna\r\n",
    "we are taking have you seen here you see here in the see here\r\n",
    "in the uh in the beginning of the table i i\r\n",
    "understood i understood so here what we've done is we've taken the lagna and we are calculating of course 15\r\n",
    "degrees and that's how the original lagna in chart and the lakna in bhava chakra\r\n",
    "will always be same right yes that that's okay in in chakra\r\n",
    "we are doing the same thing is what i've understood because\r\n",
    "we are doing the same thing with the different starting position okay so you see here in this table in\r\n",
    "this slide you see that the lagna is on 26 degree degrees yes and you see in the next\r\n",
    "slide baba lagne is on 25th degree\r\n",
    "okay okay you will see in the in the uh\r\n",
    "you will see in the software there is how to calculate okay this is already a calculated value\r\n",
    "it's already already calculated okay is something which is twice faster than\r\n",
    "lagna okay okay okay so and\r\n",
    "are we going to learn how to calculate this in this session is this is that something we need to figure out this is\r\n",
    "check from it's calculated in the software and you see and this is the calculation\r\n",
    "of bava chile chakra that is all that we need to do to add 15 degrees below and after\r\n",
    "and check the positions there will be separate classes on\r\n",
    "special agnes i'm now here just doing baba chalice chakra okay\r\n",
    "okay so to create a vowel chili chakra we should learn to how to calculate the\r\n",
    "parabologna and then do this procedure yes and you have biology already in the software okay that is given with\r\n",
    "the degrees okay so you see in the chakra what we are using here\r\n",
    "is uh is the starting position is fava lagna\r\n",
    "which is one of the special agnes so next is the\r\n",
    "so you see in uh in swamiji's case again here what we are getting\r\n",
    "is that the venus shift position the mars shift position and the guru\r\n",
    "three grahas are shifting positions every time when there are these uh big shifts\r\n",
    "of when there is a lot of planets which are changing their places\r\n",
    "there that should show that there will be major events in the life that there will be\r\n",
    "a lot of uh rooted uh\r\n",
    "changes and transform from transformation in the in the life okay\r\n",
    "so you see that the as as i said the baba chalit chakra we\r\n",
    "will learn no bhava lagna chakra we will learn\r\n",
    "in the separate class that's why i just wanted to to speak a little bit about bhava chalit chakra\r\n",
    "biological clock okay what you need to do\r\n",
    "you need to to draw your chart your bhava chalit chakra\r\n",
    "okay and in the place where the sun is\r\n",
    "placed put 6 am\r\n",
    "in the bava in the 7th house from the sun place\r\n",
    "6 pm okay\r\n",
    "and then after that we should we should create the the chart you see here\r\n",
    "it is given\r\n",
    "the the place where the the sun is is is the place of the sun rise\r\n",
    "that's why why we are taking the approximation of 6am is approximate\r\n",
    "sunrise this is the position of the sun\r\n",
    "yes in my rashi chart i have the sun in mesha in the in the fifth house\r\n",
    "here the sun is in uh rishabha but we are taking this the position of\r\n",
    "the sun in it and you see this bl is\r\n",
    "what we are interested in we are not interested in this\r\n",
    "this we don't care the about the the the lagna in we're what we are taking here is\r\n",
    "about bhavatali that is something what we are\r\n",
    "seeing here you see this\r\n",
    "so i have the sun in the fourth house from baba lagna here is the sun\r\n",
    "the kendra is good the sun will show the level of energy\r\n",
    "okay so if the sun in this uh\r\n",
    "if the sun in this chart is badly placed in the sixth eighth or twelfth house then we are\r\n",
    "having the lack of energy okay so what you need to to find\r\n",
    "is this is the the chakra of the how the things are functioning in our\r\n",
    "biological clock in a daily dynamic okay\r\n",
    "you you will see that when we are uh when are the best\r\n",
    "the times for for us to do the things\r\n",
    "so moon is related to ray or food so\r\n",
    "for me the best time to eat is in between 10 a.m\r\n",
    "till 12 till noon you see because of the position of the\r\n",
    "moon when is the best time to exercise\r\n",
    "the mars is exercising\r\n",
    "so you see here mars is at midnight maybe it's good for for me\r\n",
    "to exercise the midnight but what we are also seeing is that the mars here is\r\n",
    "placed in one house and having the aspects on the\r\n",
    "old house from itself on this seventh house\r\n",
    "from itself so mars is having\r\n",
    "aspects on the fourth house the seventh house from\r\n",
    "itself and eighth house from itself okay so when the good time for me\r\n",
    "to exercise is to do any mangle activity\r\n",
    "is from 10 a.m till 12 from 12 till 2 00 pm\r\n",
    "and from 6 p.m till 8 pm again so understand when you find the\r\n",
    "activity of the graha this is the best times to use it\r\n",
    "okay so for example when you need to make the decisions\r\n",
    "when you need to make the you me yes yes\r\n",
    "mangal is at 12 pm you mean noon right not midnight right\r\n",
    "no in my case\r\n",
    "in my case the the mangala is it is at midnight okay okay you are not\r\n",
    "talking about this chart you see the mars is at the first pm\r\n",
    "here okay is this clear yes\r\n",
    "so but what i'm saying is for example you see uh\r\n",
    "there is a there is a for example mars is exercising is uh the the mars rule\r\n",
    "which is the strength in the body so when you want to increase\r\n",
    "the strength in the body for me it is the midnight should be the best\r\n",
    "but of course the midnight the sleep should be there so what we are taking we are taking the\r\n",
    "aspects of mars\r\n",
    "yes there is a typo okay sorry so this is the the fifth house is\r\n",
    "midnight\r\n",
    "the fifth house is actually it is the seventh house this is\r\n",
    "the midnight okay so we can do it like that so\r\n",
    "the when you find the activity that should be done\r\n",
    "it can be done for outer planets for shiny for guru for mars\r\n",
    "it can be done with we have three three four times to choose so you see\r\n",
    "for mars he's aspecting fourth seventh and eighth house from itself which means that all of these times are\r\n",
    "can be taken buddha is for reading\r\n",
    "so when you want to read something what when is the best time this is the way how the our uh\r\n",
    "how our brain will function the most how our brain we will use the potential\r\n",
    "okay the the best position is where the\r\n",
    "it is placed okay but also what we are taking is\r\n",
    "what they are expecting okay so for food it's the moon\r\n",
    "for learning it is the uh for learning and reading and also\r\n",
    "playing it is the mars\r\n",
    "guru is the jupiter brings the the big decisions every time when we need to decide\r\n",
    "something or to digest something or to to make the conclusions about something\r\n",
    "it is jupiter and also related to the learning sun is the spiritual practice\r\n",
    "okay and uh so what else\r\n",
    "shannon yeah shani is for resting\r\n",
    "shani is what is the best time to rest and also what you need to to to know\r\n",
    "that all of these grahas are the in the span of uh\r\n",
    "all of these grahas are in the span of two hours all of these bubbles okay\r\n",
    "so that here we don't need to rest complete two hours but inside\r\n",
    "for example in my case the shunning is from 10 p.m till 12\r\n",
    "till midnight so what is happening here is that in that time i should find at least some\r\n",
    "15 minutes to rest because that is what my biological clock\r\n",
    "is demanding from me okay\r\n",
    "rahu is that showing the time where there should not be activities\r\n",
    "okay\r\n",
    "venus is for the relationships\r\n",
    "yeah and indulging ourselves also so that is the the venus\r\n",
    "okay so rahu is the activities which\r\n",
    "should is the time of the of the day where should not be any activity\r\n",
    "but the problem here what we are facing is with that that rahu is\r\n",
    "is having the the drishtis on the fifth house from itself\r\n",
    "on the seventh house from itself on the ninth house from itself\r\n",
    "and on the second house from itself okay\r\n",
    "so you see it's not something that can be fully used or example when there is a\r\n",
    "when there is a uh\r\n",
    "when there when there are grahas conjoined that means that both the grahas are\r\n",
    "wanting the same time so what what is the thing here is that we should then devote to\r\n",
    "each and every one sometime okay\r\n",
    "when rahu and sun are conjoined there in those two hours the sun will want something for itself\r\n",
    "and the rahu will want something so\r\n",
    "meditate and then uh create a break from everything okay\r\n",
    "that is how bhava chalit chakra one of the of the no\r\n",
    "not no in no no no no this is for a personal use okay\r\n",
    "here is meditation ghetto is also avoiding the activities so the best for\r\n",
    "rahu and ketu is to meditate\r\n",
    "okay this is how our\r\n",
    "this is this chart baba chalice chakra is dynamic chart of it\r\n",
    "is representing how our brain is reacting through the the through the\r\n",
    "time in a day okay so that's this is with with the help of\r\n",
    "this chart you can help yourself in order to to use the better potential because you\r\n",
    "know sometimes what is happening for example buddha is reading and you know sometimes\r\n",
    "you sit and to to learn something or to\r\n",
    "to read something and it's simply not entering the mind\r\n",
    "that means that we didn't choose one of the times where the buddha is aspecting\r\n",
    "later there will be more usage of it but this is one uh\r\n",
    "very plain and the the usage that can be uh practically\r\n",
    "applied okay so what you need to do you need to to draw\r\n",
    "the chart the the bhava chalit chakra for yourself\r\n",
    "and then and then create this table this table\r\n",
    "will help you to to organize and everything so\r\n",
    "here see what i what i will do now is to open\r\n",
    "that you see here usually it's navajo\r\n",
    "can you see that this screen no\r\n",
    "yeah the timing is calculating uh antisode directly it is because\r\n",
    "you see the the sun\r\n",
    "when the sun is in the first house\r\n",
    "that is the that is the six a.m so from six\r\n",
    "till uh from sixth till eighth it will be sun okay\r\n",
    "but then from the the baba point the sun will go to the\r\n",
    "twelfth house okay you see\r\n",
    "because there is this uh movement\r\n",
    "so if shunning for the rest which graha is for working\r\n",
    "no the the working is buddha buddha is for also he is\r\n",
    "but it's depending also what you can do is that what what you need to do you\r\n",
    "check up the activity of the work\r\n",
    "okay check up the activity of the work\r\n",
    "if somebody is a teacher in the in the school that activity would be\r\n",
    "guru if somebody is uh working in the factory\r\n",

    "- Use **pronunciation**, not spelling\n",
    "- Drop incomplete consonants (without following vowel)\n",
    "- **Ra/La rule:** If consonants joined with R or L, keep only initial consonant\n",

    "gracha and that's why we shared or we we kind of split all these all these lessons in three parts so that\r\n",
    "we can really focus on what is there and kind of you know extract as much juice as we can\r\n",
    "from each and every lesson you know and uh so we have plenty to cover\r\n",
    "and um you have probably heard guruji i would like to start with this you have probably heard guruji saying\r\n",
    "how traditionally you know uh is open or it starts or we start\r\n",
    "teaching it uh through the uh the third chapter basically with this very chapter on\r\n",
    "graham and and that was done for several reasons first because the first two\r\n",
    "chapters are really advanced chapters so the or the uh\r\n",
    "the the creation as well as the as well as the art or the second chapter a really\r\n",
    "advanced concept so you know in the in the village you know you would start teaching with the\r\n",
    "third chapter and that's something how we did as well but as soon as the this course became in an online course it made more sense\r\n",
    "to to have all of the chapters as they are included in the course because some of you are\r\n",
    "beginners so it made more sense to to introduce you to the fundamentals of the of the jiotis\r\n",
    "what are the 33 what are some of the time concepts what are the concepts in general\r\n",
    "before we can get into you know rashes and everything else so this is something that you know you\r\n",
    "could hear guruji talking about and also he he said something something that you should\r\n",
    "you we have probably heard and that is that you know it's his job to take you first round you know\r\n",
    "once through the whole of the of the of the book of the parashara so he will take you once\r\n",
    "through all the lessons and all the shlokas but then it's up to you to do that you know again\r\n",
    "and again you know he says it takes at least three times for you to study these shlokas before they are truly yours\r\n",
    "before they are digested so what we are going to do is exactly\r\n",
    "that we are going to go with you basically guruji is teaching all the shlokas and jayco and eyes\r\n",
    "mentors are going to help you you know get all the answers and confusions of a\r\n",
    "or confusions of a and all the answers front so that you can really go through that once\r\n",
    "solidly and then after that i assume you're gonna go back and then you know you have this extra\r\n",
    "resource and that's this audio book from another another uh badge that is also there for\r\n",
    "your preview so that as a second viewing i would also suggest that you then listen to that\r\n",
    "and then basically fill in the gaps because every time when guru just teaches\r\n",
    "he teaches some new aspect you you it's rare that he's going to repeat himself and even if he repeats himself he's\r\n",
    "going to repeat and then add to that so which each and with each and every listening you're going to learn\r\n",
    "something more okay so first\r\n",
    "thing about this\r\n",
    "first thing i wanted to say to mention is basically what that what the third chapter\r\n",
    "is open with you know the first topic so in the first local the third chapter\r\n",
    "parashar muni defines this you know all the heavenly bodies based on two factors\r\n",
    "and that is based on their visibility or side and based on their movement so then he\r\n",
    "says that you know just in the first sloka he goes on to explain that those shining bodies of all\r\n",
    "of those shining bodies that we can see in the night sky you know those that are moving are called and those that are fixed are\r\n",
    "called nakshatra and he calls them with a very specific\r\n",
    "you know for a very good reason and that is that you know the graham means you know comes\r\n",
    "from the word meaning that you know it has the ability to eclipse\r\n",
    "or to size you know or to basically eclipse the mind you know and so in\r\n",
    "this this is the nature of all of the grahas you know their nature is such that they're they\r\n",
    "are gonna eclipse our minds and you know we are\r\n",
    "throughout today and other uh lessons on graham we are gonna learn in all the ways and means that they are\r\n",
    "doing so but this is very important so it's not it's not just the planet you know when we use the\r\n",
    "english word for you know as a planet it technically is not even you know correct it really is it's not\r\n",
    "just the body it is a body that has the ability or it makes in its nature is to make you know\r\n",
    "eclipse so this is the topic of this chapter how\r\n",
    "and in which ways and you know each of the grahas will have its own uh its own way of doing it so for example\r\n",
    "you know guruji every time when he teaches graham he says you know think about the gracha as a person\r\n",
    "it's just a person so for example uh and policeman will have you know will be\r\n",
    "you know let's say represented by a planet mars and the policeman will have his own ways and means to deal with the\r\n",
    "situation his own interests his own kuna his own way of speaking he's a way of you know uh creating the yoga or\r\n",
    "you know somebody with other people and the situation and like that so this is the the whole topic\r\n",
    "so there are two things one is that you know these heavenly bodies are based on the movement and another one is\r\n",
    "that you know that you know we are taking only those bodies that are visible to us\r\n",
    "so here comes this you know this whole thing about why don't we take uranus and neptune and other planets\r\n",
    "that are you know they are out there out there so parasharamuni defines you know which are the planets that are really\r\n",
    "influencing us and he says those are those that are you know those that we can see\r\n",
    "you know are those that are influencing us so those that we have knowledge of is\r\n",
    "what is influencing us also so um\r\n",
    "the question that may arise for you guys is that uh when in that case you know\r\n",
    "why are we taking rahu and ketu as the graha you know we know that rahu and ketu\r\n",
    "don't have our light per se and guru ji in a lesson i hope you catch that explains that\r\n",
    "rahu and ketu know they don't have you know first they don't have a body their mathematical points\r\n",
    "but they do have this the shadow that they are creating they do have a light and that is this\r\n",
    "inverse light so basically when you you know he explains that well in one of the lessons\r\n",
    "when you look directly to the sun you know of course your eyes are gonna hurt but when you close your eyes you\r\n",
    "still have that same image that same image or the ball but in this case it's the black color\r\n",
    "so this is this inverse line so he says that there is there is a light if you need to call it\r\n",
    "a light there is a shadow there is a light that is there that may not be you know\r\n",
    "uh uh uh how to say this not not be visible in the same way that the\r\n",
    "others are and the reason for that is this first that you said that there they are these nodes\r\n",
    "raju and ketu they're mathematical points and they are really the the uh com their nodes of the of\r\n",
    "the moon which means that they are really the uh the concept of the mind so rahu and ketu\r\n",
    "they are both in the mind and the way that they are in your mind is that they are the\r\n",
    "extremes in your mind they're like a borders in amanda the furthest away that you can really\r\n",
    "comprehend in your mind is really rahu and ketu so those are two extremes\r\n",
    "so rahu shows that extreme which is a fully material it's you know fully uh boggy so rahu\r\n",
    "will show that all those desires and all those all that you know boga that you have for eating for\r\n",
    "experiencing for traveling for enjoying and all all you know rahu just wants to eat it all\r\n",
    "you know my schedule is the other extreme ketu is the he doesn't want anything he wants\r\n",
    "to be completely detached he wants them to be left alone you know so the these are\r\n",
    "those two you know extremes basically in your mind we're going to\r\n",
    "learn more about that when we get adventure into each and every other planet\r\n",
    "but you know there's there's so much more to the rock when ghetto sometimes we get into the\r\n",
    "uh belief that because there are nine grahas and they belong to the to the um to the nine grahas that\r\n",
    "are as the other grahas but there are many factors that make them different and one of the things that you know we\r\n",
    "should never forget is that they're really nodes of the moon they have very much to\r\n",
    "do with our mind and uh what else um\r\n",
    "for example you know just to finish this on the rajon ketu now that i opened that so because they are\r\n",
    "borders of our mind they're also in a in a physical and material world they manifest\r\n",
    "as the borders as well as the geographical borders as you know borders between you know\r\n",
    "soil and you know water or between the countries et cetera and like you know when sorry between the\r\n",
    "countries between the cultures between those and all those are basically again you know\r\n",
    "social concept so again we come to the mind you know so we say that when rahu\r\n",
    "plays a predominant role uh in a chart for example let's say for for a marriage aspect we say the person\r\n",
    "has a better chance of marrying a foreigner because it is the rahu that is placing\r\n",
    "or the um he's making his own uh conditions known so he tells us\r\n",
    "through the grachana this is how it needs to be so it's you know so the it's a bigger\r\n",
    "chance that you know a person who is abroad or has a different culture religion or something like that that\r\n",
    "comes to the uh as our partner on the other hand ketu as somebody who doesn't want\r\n",
    "anything and doesn't want to be part of this society those are the you know so they can\r\n",
    "people such as outcasts can be represented with keto monks and nuns are people who have\r\n",
    "renounced the material world or material relationships you know spiritual people which have\r\n",
    "renounced even their own material name and chose the spiritual name they just cut all the\r\n",
    "all the connections with the society so those are two extremes\r\n",
    "recently i've heard this this interesting story in my in my extended family then uh there was a man who just one day\r\n",
    "decided that he wanted to live in an attic and he just moved to the attic\r\n",
    "and he lived for many years there didn't want to be part of society he didn't want to do anything he didn't go\r\n",
    "to work he didn't do he just decided to go and live in the attic and as crazy the story\r\n",
    "is after uh uh i don't know how many years he was there after some so certain so many years when\r\n",
    "the whole family gave up on the idea he they just treated him as you know outcast or you know\r\n",
    "you know an old one out he he came down and he resumed his you know\r\n",
    "responsibilities and it was so interesting to i wish i had that charge because it's such a\r\n",
    "clear indication of kettle there was a graham there was a serious eclipse there and a person just didn't\r\n",
    "want to be part of the you know society in everyday life\r\n",
    "so yeah graca and the planet then also another thing you know that is\r\n",
    "not technically right when we say planet is that you know rahu and ketu when you talk about two of them they're\r\n",
    "really not planets so they're only mathematical points but they do size and they do\r\n",
    "or cause graham to us so that's why they are part of the of the scheme of the grahas\r\n",
    "okay so after that you know natural the next shloka and the next\r\n",
    "thing that guruji uh uh starts explaining is that you know when we meant mention motions of the\r\n",
    "of the bodies then you know we needed to explain what really what the motions are really about you\r\n",
    "know and what is this motion that we are talking about and what is really important to note is that this is the\r\n",
    "this is the apparent motion because you know sun is not really moving and we\r\n",
    "know that it's us that you're moving around sun and the planets are moving in the sun that's the solar system but you know\r\n",
    "looking from the from the uh from geo centrical point you know looking from\r\n",
    "earth then all of these planets are moving this is what what we call the apparent motion and\r\n",
    "then you know uh we we derive several very important principle from these for\r\n",
    "example it is known that you know the two planets that are always moving forward and are\r\n",
    "never retrograding so they're always moving forward are uh surya and chandra or sun and moon\r\n",
    "the two luminaries so these are the two planets that are in a way establishing dharma or\r\n",
    "can we we can say that they're constantly moving one step ahead you know it's always you know\r\n",
    "you know one foot after the other and then you know we have you know these two notes that\r\n",
    "are only and constantly retrograding so we say that you know that at some time\r\n",
    "you know this rahu and ketu because they are moving in opposite directions they are going to cause eclipse of each\r\n",
    "other so then we say that ketu eclipses the moon and rahu eclipse is the surya because if\r\n",
    "all the planets are moving from west to east and rajoy and keto are moving opposite direction\r\n",
    "at some point they are going to cause the eclipse now this concept we use over and over\r\n",
    "and over again and we are going to explain it from many point many different points but this is just the explanation of\r\n",
    "eclipses that comes just based on the movement so if you know that there are\r\n",
    "the you know you know guru jews are explaining that in a course you know on the right hand you have surya and chandra the luminaries who are\r\n",
    "always moving direct and the left hand you have rahu and kierto and that are always moving retrograde or\r\n",
    "uh backwards then the rest of the planet that we call tara graca you know the five planets\r\n",
    "that represent the five tatwas they can appear as both so they can\r\n",
    "both follow the luminaries and they can follow rahu and ketu which means that when they are moving\r\n",
    "forward and when they're they are behaving as you know surya and chandra meaning that\r\n",
    "those planets those five grahas that are moving forward they're behaving you know um\r\n",
    "how to say you know normally they're behaving as it is expected you know they are um as you would yeah\r\n",
    "as you would expect them to be they are like surya and chandra you know what they are you know how how\r\n",
    "they think you know how they are you know as they appear so so they behave\r\n",
    "you know but on the other hand the planets that are moving retrograde they are behaving like rahu and ketu or\r\n",
    "the node so what does that mean so from here comes the whole thing about you know what does it even mean when a\r\n",
    "when a planet is retrograde so we say that a planet when it's retrograde it behaves like nodes\r\n",
    "meaning you know it's uh it's behaving you know it has a ah\r\n",
    "karma with itself there is an unfulfilled desire over this planet you know they are behaving oddly they are not you\r\n",
    "know they are not to be trusted you know they are um they have unexpected you know turns you\r\n",
    "know and and so on and so on so buckley planet is and uh behaves as nodes\r\n",
    "so you don't really know what's going to happen there there are several things that we do know about\r\n",
    "buckley planet the first is that you know um they are not progressing so guruji was\r\n",
    "explaining you know three three ways in which retrograde planet can move and i'm gonna come to that you know you\r\n",
    "know in a bit but when planet is retrograde it also mean that it's not you know progressing you know it's\r\n",
    "either sitting you know and uh standing in a place sorry it's either\r\n",
    "standing in a place or it's uh going back and forth like pacing in a room\r\n",
    "and what does it really mean it means that you know one of the implication of that\r\n",
    "is that a retrograde planet may not give its result and it might not give its result because\r\n",
    "you know it's not uh progressing you know it's still thinking it's it's still in dilemma it can also\r\n",
    "mean that you know rahu and ketu and that's something that we are going to learn in a third year when we speak only about the\r\n",
    "strengths and some of the strengths are coming based on the movement so then at that time you're gonna get a next\r\n",
    "layer of understanding but for example what a planet has cheshtabala or the the strength that comes from this\r\n",
    "so those planes are extremely strong they are like like the nodes they are gonna\r\n",
    "they are have a stronger power to eclipse us you know they have a stronger power to\r\n",
    "do as they wish or to do as what whatever their idea is and uh ideologies\r\n",
    "then for example in prashna chat you know if you're asking about the topic and the planner that you're asking about\r\n",
    "is vacri then you with confidence can say that it's not going to happen you know if you're talking about the\r\n",
    "marriage and the planet there is bhakri you know you can you can say one of the two things\r\n",
    "the the matter is not going to happen in this next next one year or you can say with a serious effort and\r\n",
    "at least three attempts now i won't be explaining why three attempts but there is\r\n",
    "something you know that is related to different states of the planet that give\r\n",
    "these like you know multiplications so for example if you know that the planet is bhakri we say that you know that we need\r\n",
    "to put a three times more effort it needs uh three attempts or\r\n",
    "you know it can even if it's give if it's giving a blessing that it's gonna give a three blessings\r\n",
    "so for example if you have um if you have a situation and we are\r\n",
    "talking about marriage or kids and we have bhakri planet there and avakri planet\r\n",
    "is blessing us then we can say you know aha it's not one one child it can be three children\r\n",
    "just from that one retrograde planet and then we see other things so those are those\r\n",
    "irregularities when you see you know extreme amount of let's say boyfriend girlfriends or\r\n",
    "or uh children or anything else that gets to be like you know um how to say irregular or\r\n",
    "more than you would expect it to be you know so this is this is the just the base\r\n",
    "thing that we get from understanding you know that you know there are this you know luminaries that are always\r\n",
    "moving forward the retroglade uh no that the retrograde uh uh or grahas\r\n",
    "which are up when ketu they're always retrograde and this planet in between can behave as\r\n",
    "either luminaries or either the nodes\r\n",
    "okay i hope this gives a bit more meat to to your understanding of retrogression um\r\n",
    "so yeah that's what uh the last thing is you know eight types of motion five types of of those motions are\r\n",
    "belong to the direct and three to the retrograde\r\n",
    "so there are these there are several questions about this uh retrogradation so um\r\n",
    "let's go through them so when a retrograde a planet appears to move back or pacing in a room and that's all that\r\n",
    "you could also hear that you know from guruji in a lesson and then guruji goes to be very specific\r\n",
    "about the types of retrogression and that is you know a planet can be bakra which is known as in you know as a\r\n",
    "standard retrograde uh uh movement then it can be anovacra meaning that you know it's slowly you\r\n",
    "know it's slowing down in its inte in its retrograde motion and it's kind of you know\r\n",
    "soon it's going to reach reach the uh uh kutila or stationary state and then there is this kutila you know\r\n",
    "the the when the planet is stationary now um there are several questions you\r\n",
    "know regarding this for example um sure or i believe i have answered that later\r\n",
    "on but it doesn't matter several of you have asked about this kutila if\r\n",
    "kutila applies to uh then planet is you know being stationary\r\n",
    "going from a direct to retrograde motion and from retrograde motion to direct motion again\r\n",
    "and the answer is yes so kutila applies for both those situations and soon i'm going to show you show you\r\n",
    "a chart with that so i hope that\r\n",
    "so next next thing i have written here is in direct motion gravity after the emergence of that sign\r\n",
    "but in retrograde it behaves as as if nakshatra so\r\n",
    "we go we trace back to what we were talking about how you know how this heavenly body of\r\n",
    "bodies appear to behave so if the planet is in stationary it approve it appears\r\n",
    "but it's not moving you know and could you explain that to this you know um\r\n",
    "you would feel like you know you know no you're not progressing as if you didn't matter\r\n",
    "now there was one one segment of this lesson where guruji has said could we be following could you\r\n",
    "kindly outer planet or mars they get\r\n",
    "to be when they're in the corner from the sun they get to be you know retrograde or\r\n",
    "stationary and he also says in that same breath\r\n",
    "that if the planet is opposite the sun it gets the highest you know um it causes the highest grachana\r\n",
    "meaning in other words that it has the highest retrograde motion this is considered like highest\r\n",
    "retrograde motion so i would like you to\r\n",
    "to draw a blank chart and i would like to try to to explain to you what did he mean by\r\n",
    "these 120 degrees so if you would just draw a draw a blank chart i'm gonna do the same\r\n",
    "and then place jupiter in lagna\r\n",
    "i would just like to know if you can still hear me it's too much noise uh just for a few\r\n",
    "minutes already can you mute us because there's a lot of\r\n",
    "noise so we can't hear uh it's embarrassing yes\r\n",
    "someone needs to be muted\r\n",
    "[Music] no this is not allowed\r\n",
    "is this better\r\n",
    "oh sorry i didn't even notice that you're sending all this i have muted you again i hope it's better now\r\n",
    "now why is it that i can't hear you at all\r\n",
    "because i no anyway i hope it's better now just tell me if it's better now if you can hear me clearly\r\n",
    "great um livia you said you missed explanation which explanation\r\n",
    "what do you mean\r\n",
    "the whole slide you miss the whole thing from point three okay\r\n",
    "i'm gonna explain to you guys only till kutil has been okay i\r\n",
    "understand where you stop i think let's do this exercise and then i'm gonna repeat the whole thing again\r\n",
    "okay if you can just um draw a blank chart and place guru on\r\n",
    "lagna no just a blank chart no rashi it's not\r\n",
    "needed just jupiter online now what i wanted to explain to you is something that you\r\n",
    "know that is kind of you know partly hidden at least it was hidden to me for a long time when it comes to\r\n",
    "why and how planets are retrograde you know in this outer planet specifically uh when they're in corner from the sun\r\n",
    "so if you place guru on lagna and then guruji says and we read this his statement that\r\n",
    "uh let's uh that you know guru gets to be retrograde of stationary in a\r\n",
    "corner from the sun meaning in 100 when hits 120 degrees from the sun\r\n",
    "so what we can do now is you can uh write sure in the fifth house of that\r\n",
    "chart and surya in the ninth house of that chart\r\n",
    "so now we have guru and lagna and surah surya that is 120 degrees from the guru\r\n",
    "so we can mark that you know fifth and the ninth house as a potentially kutila or stationary\r\n",
    "you can write down kutila there so for outer planets you know mangal\r\n",
    "guru and shani and in this case we are taking guru as an example if surah is in the fifth\r\n",
    "roman or nine from it there is a potential that guru is stationary\r\n",
    "what does it mean so if suri is in a fifth from the guru it is just about to go retrograde\r\n",
    "and then when it's in the ninth house it's just about to finish retrogradation\r\n",
    "so then we can read the rest of the guruji sentence if you remember guruji said the planet which is\r\n",
    "uh the opposite the sun has the highest retrogradation so now you can write in a seven from the\r\n",
    "guru i mean in this in uh in the seventh house of that child highest retrogradation\r\n",
    "and what does it mean highest retrogradation it means that basically it has the highest grachana\r\n",
    "meaning or in other words you know what is not said what it's implied is that you know that planet is really behaving like\r\n",
    "a node that's why we are saying that you know retrograde planets behave like a node\r\n",
    "so now that now that we did that so now you have surya in the fifth house and sure in the ninth house basically 120 degrees from\r\n",
    "guru those are potassium potential stationary placements it's just about to go retrograde and just about finish with\r\n",
    "degradation so now we don't have sixth and the eighth house from the guru so sixth house then is bakra\r\n",
    "or has the nature of the mars and then the eighth house could be anubhakra\r\n",
    "or has the nature of the rahu so this is what guruji was talking about\r\n",
    "when he was talking about you know that planet goes valkyrie then in kona from\r\n",
    "the sun now i wish i could expand on this and\r\n",
    "fill out the other houses and tell you exactly where the other uh\r\n",
    "what's the name the other types of motion will be but i can't say that in a full confident\r\n",
    "you know fully confident because i i was not taught that but let's just you know based on this we can\r\n",
    "assume that when the sun is in the fourth or the tenth house\r\n",
    "then it is in in the range of having a direct motion so from the fourth house\r\n",
    "all the way to the planet it has it covers one of those five types of motion there are direct motions\r\n",
    "okay does this make sense does it make sense for you guys does it help having a picture in front\r\n",
    "of you perfect okay great so this can be done\r\n",
    "you know for all the outer planets now if you ask me the question i asked as well i was like\r\n",
    "what about you know two in a two planets that are closer to the sun meaning two rajas planets buddha and\r\n",
    "sukra now i was never given explanation and the reason is\r\n",
    "deeply astronomical you know and you know every time when i would ask that you know i was referred\r\n",
    "to surya siddhanta so i wouldn't even venture to try and\r\n",
    "explain that you know so i'll just give you the same answer that i was given you know for that\r\n",
    "you need to have a serious story sedan research and the reason is because you know it is\r\n",
    "about the movement of the of the uh planet around uh uh and then the movement of all the\r\n",
    "other bodies and their combined movement makes it really crazy to to even have like a focal point so\r\n",
    "we know this much and i hope this much helps\r\n",
    "do you still have noise because i did mute all of you\r\n",
    "no there is no more noise okay perfect okay great so um\r\n",
    "one of your one of your question was you know and i placed it here in the in the in the slide is do we literally place\r\n",
    "that planet in the opposite sign and read the chart and the answer is no in fact\r\n",
    "so uh the in the answer is no we don't we don't move planets you know planet is\r\n",
    "where it is so for example you know as guruji said you know when you think\r\n",
    "about the graha think about the person so if you have a boyfriend that\r\n",
    "behaves very oddly you know and you don't understand it and behaves like you know in all sorts of weird ways\r\n",
    "you know that's kind of like a rocky planet but you you know he's still the boyfriend so he still needs to be there very very\r\n",
    "it is so planet stays where it is but it gets the nature of the retrograde\r\n",
    "planets or sorry it gets the nature of the behavior from the nodes\r\n",
    "so the whole story about how nodes behave apply for that to that planet\r\n",
    "so no another question that was also sent to me and it's basically the part of this\r\n",
    "question is do we then place that planet is opposite sign do we see the yoga in that opposite sign do we\r\n",
    "read it as in you know in that different rashi and the answer to all of that is no now the planet stays very teased it's\r\n",
    "just guess the nature of the retrograde planet now we do say that if that planet is\r\n",
    "exalted or debilitated because of the its vac replacement meaning because it behaves it behaves\r\n",
    "uh how to say this uh as an extreme uh opposite to the to the luminaries\r\n",
    "so the same thing you know this planet has the ability to cancel its exaltation or debilitation but this is\r\n",
    "something that you know you're going to learn all about in the next lesson on graham when we talk about\r\n",
    "planets in the rushes exaltation debilitation etc so then you you're gonna understand\r\n",
    "better really the whole package of that but no we leave the planet where it is\r\n",
    "we just know that there is something very peculiar about that planet\r\n",
    "okay i'm going to read your message in a bit i just wanted to show you this chart\r\n",
    "then and in this chart you know uh\r\n",
    "um i wanted to so some of you will recognize this is the chart of pandit\r\n",
    "sanjarat and this is exactly the the the what we were talking about previously so\r\n",
    "in guruji's chart he has jupiter on lagna and sun is placed in a fifth from the jupiter so\r\n",
    "the first thing that you know this is the situation where we would get curious so we can see that the planet is not retrograde\r\n",
    "and we don't have issue recognizing that red planet because each software will show that the planet is\r\n",
    "retrograde but we can see here that jupiter is placed you know that the sun is in the fifth from\r\n",
    "jupiter and jupiter is not retrograde so then we would get suspicious if this jupiter is stationary and then we get to\r\n",
    "this small small little thing here called velocity and then we see here you know that\r\n",
    "jupiter i don't know how big or small this is on your screens but i hope you can see that jupiter is has the velocity value\r\n",
    "of 7 which is very very low and then we can conclude oh okay this jupiter is stationary\r\n",
    "now if you ask me about how stationary we don't have those ranges to to give to\r\n",
    "you per se you know and say the each of this motion is you know this you know from this range\r\n",
    "to this range is this motion we don't have that but the very very the next\r\n",
    "best best thing for you guys is to then go and see few days before and few days after how\r\n",
    "much jupiter was moving you know and was or was not moving so this jupiter\r\n",
    "is considered stationary so in the velocity when you see the closest to the zero also means you\r\n",
    "know closest to the no movement you know there's always some moment but\r\n",
    "you know that is kind of the um implication or how you can use this then what else\r\n",
    "do we uh have here we said that the plant which is opposite the sun has the highest\r\n",
    "uh uh retrograde or uh motion or it has the in fact gurujis explicitly\r\n",
    "said it has the highest so we see that you know in the seventh from the sun\r\n",
    "there is saturn and we can see that saturn is retrograde fine that's what we were expecting so\r\n",
    "this planet has can cause the highest grachana and then we see here in velocity\r\n",
    "that you know it's minus 223 percent what does it mean first minus\r\n",
    "means that the planets is more is uh having a retrograde movement that's number one but then you\r\n",
    "know uh the second thing is that you know that it's 223 it's kind of like you know\r\n",
    "it's um double as uh how to say the retrogradation is\r\n",
    "double or it's uh double uh uh speed of direct regulation\r\n",
    "is such so this is a really deep retrogradation i hope this is the most accurate\r\n",
    "terminology for this and this can be seen with this high number\r\n",
    "um now what else can i say about this because\r\n",
    "there are several questions about how to use velocity now there is this is not really\r\n",
    "there is nothing such as you know if there was something very exact about how to use this velocity\r\n",
    "guruji would uh include it in a course and it would be given to you\r\n",
    "and i wish it there was but no we can use it you know as as i mentioned you know as\r\n",
    "in you know kind of like indicator of what is happening you know we know that the minus is a retrograde\r\n",
    "the retrograde motion of the planet we know that that around zero means indication of you know no\r\n",
    "movement or a stationary planet and we know that you know which is uh that which is you know\r\n",
    "really really high in the uh miners or in a plus means a very high or fast fast movement\r\n",
    "so it can be one of those atichara etc so i hope this answers your answers your\r\n",
    "questions about the velocity unfortunately i don't have the ranges of the motions or we don't have\r\n",
    "and i have asked other mentors to so i'm sure that we didn't lost there somewhere\r\n",
    "no we don't have that but please use what we have so i'm just gonna just to be sure\r\n",
    "check our time let's let's move on through all the questions and\r\n",
    "then i'm going to check your questions in the chat as well then you send me a bunch of questions\r\n",
    "about the gothi uh and i think i answered that so sri jyoti star presents\r\n",
    "the speed of the plants as a percentage velocity how do we interpret this this is something what i have answered\r\n",
    "so minus means that retrograde motion closer to zero stationary high positive number indicate\r\n",
    "higher speed and you know this was the guruji's example previous example\r\n",
    "then the second question was about the kutilag is defined as retrograde that stations\r\n",
    "prior to going direct does the definition include the direct planet the stations and\r\n",
    "you know and then goes yes that's something what we answered it includes both stationary when it you know it's not\r\n",
    "like you know you know planet is not turning around but it does you know station for a\r\n",
    "second and that's how it appears to be before it starts moving ahead again\r\n",
    "uh what is the range of motion that is considered kutila does it have to be zero\r\n",
    "is there a zero motion that that is two-hour period speaks of and this is where our answer\r\n",
    "that i'm not sure we did we were never taught about that so the best that i can say to you is you know surya\r\n",
    "siddhanta is your friend for that\r\n",
    "this is interesting question and this is the question that is going to answer many of your other questions when it comes to some\r\n",
    "yoga and yoga in general and that is uh so this the student is asking i didn't get when guruji was\r\n",
    "teaching about karacha showing different color in akshatra and rashi can we have this including webinar about\r\n",
    "the gracha moment so about the graham moment in russia versus nakshatra so imagine this\r\n",
    "imagine you know you remember we were talking about the three lokas or three manifested words\r\n",
    "and those three words uh worlds are uh so buloka the earth where we are where\r\n",
    "russia's are so russia is the the the plane where all all these material things are all the\r\n",
    "resources are and all the materials interactions are happening material interactions are happening\r\n",
    "then above buloka is bhuvaloka and that is the solar system where the sun and the\r\n",
    "planets are so this is so above us is the plane where all the\r\n",
    "or all the grahas are moving and then about that is a swagaloka where we say it's a nakshatra plane or the day when\r\n",
    "devatas are residing so when agraha is moving in truth so the\r\n",
    "truth is that the graha is moving through the nakshatras and it's kind of throwing you know a\r\n",
    "shadow graham what we call the grahana it's throwing a shadow on certain parts of nakshatra and center\r\n",
    "parts of rashi you know basically you can say that the graha is the one who who binds the two\r\n",
    "the rashi and nakshatra so the by with graha's movement he binds those\r\n",
    "nakshatras significations and the rashes significations now what are nakshatras to understand\r\n",
    "this we really need to be very clear about water nakshatras and water rushes so nakshatras is really our mental plane\r\n",
    "we know that the nakshatras are defined that they are lunar concept that they\r\n",
    "are defined based on the movement of the moon it's the night concept so nakshatras are\r\n",
    "all about our thoughts and our emotions so this is the nakshatras\r\n",
    "when the planet is moving through nakshatra it's throwing like like a filter or a\r\n",
    "shadow on some of those nakshatras so in all of the nakshatras when there is no graha\r\n",
    "present you know you have what is called like a your normal let's say that's the standard that's\r\n",
    "very normal but every place where graham is throwing a shadow of an akshatra then you have your own lens of thinking\r\n",
    "and feeling so this is not normal you know and when i say it's not normal\r\n",
    "it is very specific to you this is how you are having you know your thoughts and emotions\r\n",
    "and now so if you know that the nakshatras are your thoughts and your emotions your ideas and all of\r\n",
    "that and we know that the grachas are also throwing shadow on the rashes\r\n",
    "now the rashes are all the resources that we have all the material resources all the\r\n",
    "things that you can you know just look around yourself and everything that you see that is rashi so what graha does it also\r\n",
    "throws the shadow on some of those rashes and that is where we experience grachana\r\n",
    "so in some of those places we have a very peculiar way of the of being so what is really the\r\n",
    "difference between the two when the gracha is moving in when the uh\r\n",
    "or let me answer this this question you know if the planets are in the same rushi\r\n",
    "they are kind of they are sharing they're like two people sharing the resources and there are two people creating new\r\n",
    "resources and they're in agreement about the resources that are they are you know they're all about the material\r\n",
    "things so what is fructifying really you know here on a plane earth if they're sharing the same nakshatra at\r\n",
    "the same time they have the same thoughts and ideas you know they might have the same agenda\r\n",
    "but if two planets are same as uh uh conjoined in the same rashi but they are\r\n",
    "in different akshatras those are like two people they are working on the same project\r\n",
    "here on earth but they have different ideas different different emotions you know different\r\n",
    "mental you know attitudes you know so this is the this is where you find\r\n",
    "sorry this is where you find you know answer to all of those\r\n",
    "questions uh as to you know what if the planets in the same russia but different exchange what if they are you know and\r\n",
    "same nakshatra different rashes and and so so so forth so\r\n",
    "just always go back to what is nakshatra what is rashi and how could this the same planet makes\r\n",
    "this interaction now just to finish this this graha\r\n",
    "you know the it can act on a material you know so this shadow that falls on the on the on on\r\n",
    "the earth it can act based on some thoughts and emotions that we have\r\n",
    "so what thoughts and emotions mars would have so he's in a light or or uh or his color\r\n",
    "or his filter would be red we connect mars with the red so there were some thoughts or emotions\r\n",
    "about protection or anger or you know attack or a conflict something like that in our\r\n",
    "you know mind in the nakshatra that has manifested itself in the material as mars doing\r\n",
    "something in our you know in in that russian that power but it can also be the other way around\r\n",
    "something may happen to us somebody else did something which is gonna be transferred to mars\r\n",
    "that is gonna cause us to think you know those thoughts as in you know such as you know\r\n",
    "oh i need to protect myself or this was an attack or an an attack on me or i am angry now because of this or you\r\n",
    "know protecting or whatever it is so i hope this explains this is what guruji was\r\n",
    "thinking or what he was implying to when he said how we see it differently graha then how they were to\r\n",
    "see graham so if i need to say it in you know in a in a 3d\r\n",
    "you know it would seem as if you know we are looking up you know and the day was looking down\r\n",
    "um this is a really good intro i'm gonna leave this you know how to energize the the ring you know when i um\r\n",
    "when i uh how to say stop you know sharing screen just remind me but i wanted to to go\r\n",
    "through other questions which are related to some yoga just so we don't skip something so um you know four types of alumni\r\n",
    "is an important concept but i won't be spending much time on this today because just the next lesson or the lesson after\r\n",
    "that that you will be doing with real cause in depth i'm explaining all this\r\n",
    "but you know one of the questions that i did receive that i think i should answer now is how do we know that the\r\n",
    "per time how do we know birth time based on the placement of surya so it's it's uh it's quite easy you know\r\n",
    "if we know the what is that we are talking about it's it's kind of easy to get the answer as well\r\n",
    "so if we know that the ascended is the udaya lagna so the rising land the lagna you know\r\n",
    "the the rising you know the um the first sign that is arising in in uh\r\n",
    "at the time of the sunrise you know the lagna lagna and on the opposite side side you\r\n",
    "know that's the east and the opposite side is the astalagna or the setting lagna you know and those two are always in the\r\n",
    "same level so when we say enough same level meaning that you know that you know just as we can see the sunrise\r\n",
    "you can also see the sunset and those are us and others seventh house so us and our\r\n",
    "partners ours and you know other people in our life etc etc but then we have this other\r\n",
    "uh two lagnas and that is fourth house shows jolla lagna and the whole concept of the jala lagna\r\n",
    "is really about the mother and about the healing and about the you know the\r\n",
    "qualities of heart and the comfort and the whole thing is really the fourth house\r\n",
    "everything that we find at home the rest the replenishment the health everything is there in a fourth house\r\n",
    "and it's and then we have opposite of that is the uh is the akash now the tenth house\r\n",
    "and the akash lag nay is like a guy looking up you know all our successes all that we are striving for so these\r\n",
    "two that are in opposites in our fourth and the tenth house they are not in line in fact the akash\r\n",
    "lagna shows up to the sky you know and uh fourth house shows\r\n",
    "down or the uh you know what is below our feet or the mother earth so that's why the fourth\r\n",
    "house is also the root of all the you know worship of the mother and mother uh mahavidya and so on and so on so we use\r\n",
    "this concept you know we we are always going to circle back to these things we're just\r\n",
    "going to add each time more to it such as you know these are also related to the gayatri's yes these are also\r\n",
    "related to the remedies and so on but to come back to the question you know how do we know\r\n",
    "you know based on surya's placement you know when the person was born but we know because you know if sun is\r\n",
    "on lagna then you know or udaya lagna ascended we know that the person is born very close to the sunrise\r\n",
    "if it's in 7th you know it's the sunset if it's in the 10th house person is born close to the midday you\r\n",
    "know and the fourth house it's around it's a nighttime you know around midnight so if\r\n",
    "for example i were to tell you that i was born at 3 p.m\r\n",
    "you know you could then understand okay so it it my son should be somewhere\r\n",
    "either in the ninth or the eighth house you know it needs to be somewhere between the midday\r\n",
    "and the sunset so it's somewhere around there so i hope this answers your question\r\n",
    "then we come to some yoga now there are many many uh there is a there is a lots of\r\n",
    "terminology in this part of the lesson and some of them are uh is really\r\n",
    "important and i wanted to point out to all of those that are really um\r\n",
    "just a second\r\n",
    "um i was just checking your your your message is to be sure that everything is fine so uh i wanted to in\r\n",
    "in this time that we have together i wanted to point to you everything that you should uh take from\r\n",
    "here and also tell you the things that you know we learned here and we didn't really use\r\n",
    "for the rest of the course you know and i do this for for more reasons than one you know if\r\n",
    "there is something that you know we are going to learn in detail there is a specific lesson of that painting just around the corner or in\r\n",
    "the different year of parashara it makes sense that you have that information so you don't feel like you\r\n",
    "know this is it you know we we have mentioned retrogression we are never going to come back to that you know and i\r\n",
    "i know that there is more to it don't don't uh worry for example retrogression\r\n",
    "is done in the third year where we are talking about the bala's abolish based on the movement based on all sorts\r\n",
    "of you know criteria mutual you know position uh placement in the rashi\r\n",
    "um yoga and all these things so we are going to learn more and more and more on that\r\n",
    "that also applies to graha yoda you know many of you have asked me about the kraken and guruji have mentioned that\r\n",
    "there are four types and four ways of interpretation yes they are but we are not going to learn them now what we are learning now\r\n",
    "is just the basics of the yoga you know we are just entering the you know how to\r\n",
    "think about the yoga you know how to yeah you know kind of opening our mind to all the things that we didn't even\r\n",
    "consider prior to this lesson you know and then down the line we are going to also learn\r\n",
    "yoga uh ayuda and we are going to learn it in a detail so\r\n",
    "let me let me come back to the some yoga lessons so some yoga refers to all ways and\r\n",
    "means in which planet can combine with other planets you know which planet can combine with the nakshatras with rashes and\r\n",
    "everything so everything any type of a connection but what we the reason why you don't hear as much\r\n",
    "the the terminology some yoga is that because of all of those connections you know\r\n",
    "accidental and you know important and less important and vague and all this you know we are really impo interested\r\n",
    "in some bandha so some banda is the terminology which is you know is a term which is really\r\n",
    "important and which we are going to use over and over again sambada is been you know the com combining of the\r\n",
    "two planets or the bodies you know uh is such that has um\r\n",
    "that has a great impact so uh there is a very they we define the\r\n",
    "sambantha that there are you know basically four types of sambanda and one of which we are just open now\r\n",
    "and that is the ut so a very specific four of some banda is that for example when the planets are\r\n",
    "in the ut you know that that connection of the two bodies is really important and it's\r\n",
    "really impactful there are many others that don't create as much impact so we don't really you know spend\r\n",
    "so much you don't hear much about it you know we don't spend as much about time on it when there are so many other\r\n",
    "things that are really there and can be felt you know in a chart so somebody is what is really important so\r\n",
    "and then you know that's that's one thing that is important from now on and another thing is you know this concept\r\n",
    "of some youngest porter so there is some yoga sputter that you that you have\r\n",
    "learned here and that is you know when the two planets are together you know but they are not you know\r\n",
    "sharing nakshatra then we have this you know this uh mathematical point\r\n",
    "calculated to know exactly what is there like a meeting point and then this is really you know\r\n",
    "important in you know in a chart reading but you know out of this uh some yogas put that there is another\r\n",
    "thing that is important and that is yoga sport so this yoga sputter concept is something that we are going to study\r\n",
    "in detail over the years and that is that you know we can really you know find a spoot\r\n",
    "of many different bodies they don't even need to be in the same rashi or in the same same\r\n",
    "what's the name same russia they don't need to share the rashi or being a conjunction to\r\n",
    "to for us to calculate yoga sputa so later on we are going to learn how you can basically\r\n",
    "for various purposes combined let's say lagna lord in the seventh lord and find the yoga sputter\r\n",
    "so this is something for the later date let's come back to the sam yoga's buddha\r\n",
    "so based on this you know based on this uh we learned one\r\n",
    "important concept and that is that there are yogas or conjunctions that are going to\r\n",
    "fructify them in the future that are about to happen and or they are going to happen in the\r\n",
    "future and we call them bavisia yoga so all of those combinations and guruji\r\n",
    "mentioned many names for it but in one way you know we can we can call them\r\n",
    "those are yogas or those are you know babysitted yogas all of those that are\r\n",
    "going to happen sometime in the future west all of those based on the movement of the planets that are\r\n",
    "that are not going to happen meaning in other words they have they had happened in the past\r\n",
    "you know that those things were in the past you know they happened in the past they have some\r\n",
    "they had some impact in the past are called atita yoga or v yoga\r\n",
    "so basically yoga and me yoga is is the same as saying you know there is\r\n",
    "a babysitter yoga now you know you might ask you know\r\n",
    "why is it that you know we would calculate you know some yoga sputa for a tita yoga\r\n",
    "or a v yoga and the reason is you know because you know the one can reason you\r\n",
    "know it's not gonna happen you know that the reason is you know if you see a yoga in a chart\r\n",
    "you know and if you see let's say you know negative yoga then you can based on the uh some yoga sputter\r\n",
    "of that yoga you know or see what is it that happened in the past that\r\n",
    "this yoga is showing you know where was the impact of that yoga in the past\r\n",
    "so this is not it's not you know it's not something that you know you're gonna you use in when you are uh seeing the\r\n",
    "client's chart there's just no time to go into those details but this is something that is you know\r\n",
    "this is of interest to you when you are studying for example for your chart and those chart that you\r\n",
    "are doing a research on and that you are doing a deep research on this could be really interesting for example two people who have the same\r\n",
    "yoga let's say same lagna and chandra ketu i happen to know the two people have\r\n",
    "uh um who are born with mito nalang and chandra ketu in the 11th house so chandra ketu is considered you know a\r\n",
    "negative yoga it's the eclipse yoga so it's not comfortable for the moon at\r\n",
    "all so if this negative yoga is there in the horoscope it would be interesting to see is this\r\n",
    "something that has happened in the past and because of that it has the impact of the person and what type of impact\r\n",
    "or is it something that's going to happen in the future and if it's going to happen in the future where is it that we can see the results\r\n",
    "so some yogas put that or that joined and joined uh uh uh uh what's the name uh\r\n",
    "place you know uh is gonna show us where is the impact now they in some of the cases you know\r\n",
    "be so that you know uh that russia for example if it was uh abhirishad yoga\r\n",
    "and the russia that we were looking for based on the nakshatra lord was not there in the in the in a front from the\r\n",
    "yoga let's say like that in a visible side from the yoga um\r\n",
    "what what happens then and then guruji in the lesson you know he mentioned few times a season\r\n",
    "but then later on he clarified to use something called samukarashi\r\n",
    "so we are not using seasons just so you know it's not uh so you don't get you know uh confused\r\n",
    "about that at the end of the lesson guruji says forget the season use samokarashi now we are going to use\r\n",
    "those season later and for other things but for in this instance use some osamu karashi\r\n",
    "and no we didn't learn samokarashis yet because this is something that comes to\r\n",
    "foreign that is taught when you come to uh uh graham\r\n",
    "so if you are uh if you want to know what are the samoka rashis for example\r\n",
    "for you know for uh leo it's makkara for karka is kumba and vice versa those would be very\r\n",
    "interesting for you was for dual rashes those are the opposite signs but if you you have any type of doubt\r\n",
    "you know write to me or even go go to the module on the rashi drishti\r\n",
    "you will find in the slides a slide naming all the samokarashis for all the\r\n",
    "rashes okay so now that that is clarified\r\n",
    "um some yoga sputter can be seen for both babies and a tita you're gonna be okay yes that i\r\n",
    "that i have explained let me just think for a second is there more that i wanted to say here\r\n",
    "um no let's see the questions maybe the questions will\r\n",
    "clarify more okay so this was one of one of the questions\r\n",
    "basically it says you know in a case of alan leah there are four planets\r\n",
    "and four plants are involved\r\n",
    "we will take the slo and so the pro this theorem has proposed should or ah he's asking uh or she uh we will take\r\n",
    "the slowest and the furthest and the fastest planet among the four in reference put in ketu\r\n",
    "and uh and take that as a result of the yoga between the four planets or we see only yoga for two planets at a\r\n",
    "time and the answer is only two planets at a time yoga is up to\r\n",
    "two so we even when we have a such a multiple\r\n",
    "conjunction situation you know a forum or three or more or something like that we always see the impact of the two\r\n",
    "bodies at the time and then you can see what these various impacts where they are\r\n",
    "most of the time or you know plenty of the time it's going to happen in the same rashi or\r\n",
    "in the same lakshatra or very close to so it's not going to be like all over the chart it's going to happen\r\n",
    "in one or two nakshatras but you're looking at only two yoga of the two planets at the time\r\n",
    "are all the tita yoga is essentially the yogurt resulting in separation yes so all latita yogas are v yogas\r\n",
    "they are you know there are some there is they're indicating that something is ending something has ended something\r\n",
    "has happened in the past something is there in a past\r\n",
    "yeah so you could you can reason you know if there is a negative yoga then you know it's good you know it's a\r\n",
    "it's a good indication if it's a positive yoga then it's in a sense it's a shame you know\r\n",
    "now of course that's not something that we do you know we don't judge it's a shame it's it is what it is it\r\n",
    "is what it is but you know just so you can add more reasoning to it\r\n",
    "but yeah aditya yogas are essentially yogas it would be great if you could\r\n",
    "give an example where the orbital influence helps us certain whether the yoga is functional or not\r\n",
    "okay so this was another question that is really important and that is in i believe in one of the uh one of the\r\n",
    "examples we saw that the two planets because of their distance and degree wise in a sign their\r\n",
    "orbits are not touching you know they are not really conforming yoga so what do we do in that in such a\r\n",
    "case so in such a case guruji has proposed to find you know the samyangasputa and see\r\n",
    "if there is a planet in kendra or kona\r\n",
    "from the yoga to uh in a close to that degree you know so that\r\n",
    "there will be a planet that can bridge the gap that's the that's the terminology that guruji used\r\n",
    "now i don't want to get into explanation of that because this is this graha that can\r\n",
    "bridge the gap of the two is called prasanga the concept is called prasanga it's going to be taught in the year 3b\r\n",
    "or year 4. just so you don't get confused about the terminology of the years\r\n",
    "you know the when the first batch went through the years you know the first year was one and then the second\r\n",
    "and third were two a two b and three and three b but so fourth year so prasanga is thought that basically\r\n",
    "it's about the how in which ways and uh which planet and uh in um yeah basically everything\r\n",
    "that has to do with the bridging of a gap besides others of deep damsha for example in practice what does it\r\n",
    "mean it means that you will see some every once in a while you will see you know that the two planets are in ut\r\n",
    "and you're running dash of one of those planets but you know something else is giving its result\r\n",
    "if some other planet is giving its result it's giving its result because there is some type of trishti on\r\n",
    "it or there is some type of serious connection to that yoga so that that plumbing could give results\r\n",
    "in the in the darshan of those two in the duty so the prasanga in that case becomes really important\r\n",
    "so um yeah that answers that and we will cover\r\n",
    "grahayuda as i said in detail in the in the third year when we talk about the bala and strains\r\n",
    "thus far you you know we have only entered all the ways in which a planet can\r\n",
    "interact we are basically just stepping into the yoga and how yoga based on the movement of\r\n",
    "the planets and how near they are how they can interact with each other\r\n",
    "so guys those are all my my slides i have waved in into into the slides all\r\n",
    "of the questions that i've received if i got something during the night i said i answered some because i some i\r\n",
    "found some questions uh uh this morning but if there are more questions please send them to me\r\n",
    "and uh i will answer them you know either on over email or on the telegram so basically every time\r\n",
    "when i see a question that i think it will be interest of interest of of uh\r\n",
    "use to all of you i will copy the question and answer in the telegram group so that you can see that and um\r\n",
    "i hope you got your answered cleared here i will uh let me just see\r\n",
    "i know we crossed the time i am just gonna go and see there's there are so many\r\n",
    "questions okay i'm gonna answer a few and then i'm gonna sit here\r\n",
    "and answer on all of the other questions in our telegram group okay i hope that is fine with you\r\n",
    "so one of the question is if ghetto causes detachment moksha can the onset of ghetto dash or\r\n",
    "mahadasha also relate to separation that in family etc etc\r\n",
    "so think about what we have talked about today okay all of the grahas they're causing\r\n",
    "so if k2 and they're causing it not only because they are placed in certain uh it's the\r\n",
    "dasha that does that as well so you know the situation when a person is like you know completely changed\r\n",
    "you know because they changed basically the dasha so the answer to your question\r\n",
    "principally is yes ketu when the dasha of ketu comes it is\r\n",
    "ketu's turn to do some graham now what is going to be the effect of\r\n",
    "the keto dasha is something that we study in adasha's basically we see you know what is that you know what is\r\n",
    "what is it that ketu does in your chart and that is how he will do but ketu will\r\n",
    "always do it in in its own way you know it's just like you know it's the it's the person you know ketu is the person\r\n",
    "and he's to do everything in his own way so yes it can principally it can be\r\n",
    "let me see some other questions quickly i am so sorry to see that you know you\r\n",
    "couldn't follow at some point because of noise i i didn't see that\r\n",
    "mom why retrograde has association with three attempts is it because there are three types of retrograde motions\r\n",
    "hmm interesting i never thought about that uh no i i don't think so i think it's it\r\n",
    "has to do with the with the strength of the retrograde planet retrograde planet is extremely\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "## Opening Context\r\n",
    "- This is the **first of three webinars** on Grahas (planets)\r\n",
    "- Traditionally, Jyotish teaching **starts with Chapter 3** (Grahas), not Chapters 1-2 (Creation/Philosophy)\r\n",
    "- Students should study Parashara shlokas **at least 3 times** to truly digest them\r\n",
    "- Use audio recordings from other batches as supplementary material\r\n",

    "1. **Visibility** (can we see them?)\r\n",
    "2. **Movement** (do they move?)\r\n",

    "- **Fixed bodies** = **Nakshatra** (fixed stars)\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "**Answer:**\r\n",
    "- They are **mathematical points** (nodes of the Moon)\r\n",
    "- They create **inverse light/shadow** (like closing eyes after seeing sun = black circle)\r\n",
    "- They represent **extremes of the mind**:\r\n",

    "**Manifestations:**\r\n",
    "- **Rahu:** Foreigners, different cultures, borders, geographical boundaries, fermentation, alcohol, medicine\r\n",
    "- **Ketu:** Outcasts, monks/nuns, spiritual people, those who renounce society\r\n",

    "1. **Always Direct (Forward):**\r\n",
    "   - **Surya (Sun) & Chandra (Moon)** - the Luminaries\r\n",

    "2. **Always Retrograde (Backward):**\r\n",
    "   - **Rahu & Ketu** - the Nodes\r\n",
    "   - Move opposite to all other planets\r\n",
    "   - Cause eclipses when they meet luminaries\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. **Can Be Either (Tara Grahas - 5 Planets):**\r\n",
    "   - **Mangala, Budha, Guru, Shukra, Shani**\r\n",
    "   - When **direct** → behave like Luminaries (normal, predictable)\r\n",
    "   - When **retrograde** → behave like Nodes (unpredictable, unfulfilled desires)\r\n",

    "- Has **Cheshtabala** (directional strength)\r\n",
    "- Can cause **highest grahana** (eclipse power)\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Prashna (Horary) Rules:**\r\n",
    "- If significator is vakri → **Won't happen** (or needs 3 attempts)\r\n",
